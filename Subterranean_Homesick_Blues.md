Released on [Bringing It All Back

In the early solo version on *The Bootleg Series*, Dylan's guitar is
capoed on the 5th fret. That's probably how it is played on the
*Bringing it All Back Home* version too.

     A
    Johnny's in the basement

    Mixing up the medicine

    I'm on the pavement

    Thinking about the government

    The man in the trench coat

    Badge out, laid off

    Says he's got a bad cough

    Wants to get it paid off
    D
    Look out kid

    It's somethin' you did
    A
    God knows when

    But you're doin' it again

    You better duck down the alley way

    Lookin' for a new friend
    E
    The man in the coon-skin cap

    In the big pen
          A
    Wants eleven dollar bills

    You only got ten

    Maggie comes fleet foot
    Face full of black soot
    Talkin' that the heat put
    Plants in the bed but
    The phone's tapped anyway
    Maggie says that many say
    They must bust in early May
    Orders from the D. A.
    Look out kid
    Don't matter what you did
    Walk on your tip toes
    Don't try "No Doz"
    Better stay away from those
    That carry around a fire hose
    Keep a clean nose
    Watch the plain clothes
    You don't need a weather man
    To know which way the wind blows

    Get sick, get well
    Hang around a ink well
    Ring bell, hard to tell
    If anything is goin' to sell
    Try hard, get barred
    Get back, write braille
    Get jailed, jump bail
    Join the army, if you fail
    Look out kid
    You're gonna get hit
    By losers, cheaters
    Six-time users       *)
    Hangin' 'round the theaters
    Girl by the whirlpool
    Lookin' for a new fool
    Don't follow leaders
    Watch the parkin' meters

    Ah get born, keep warm
    Short pants, romance, learn to dance
    Get dressed, get blessed
    Try to be a success
    Please her, please him, buy gifts
    Don't steal, don't lift
    Twenty years of schoolin'
    And they put you on the day shift
    Look out kid
    They keep it all hid
    Better jump down a manhole
    Light yourself a candle
    Don't wear sandals
    Try to avoid the scandals
    Don't wanna be a bum
    You better chew gum
    The pump don't work
    'Cause the vandals took the handles
