    Don't ya tell Henry,

    Apple's got your fly.

      E
    I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,

    A-lookin' around just to see who's born.

    I found a little chicken down on his knees,

    I went up and yelled to him,"Please, please, please!"

    He said, "Don't ya tell Henry,
    A
    Don't ya tell Henry,
    B7
    Don't ya tell Henry,
    [n.c.]           E   [turnaround]
    Elbow's got your thigh."

      E
    I went down to the corner at a-half past ten,

    I's lookin' around, I wouldn't say when.

    I looked down low, I looked above,

    And who did I see but the one I love.

              A
    She said, "Don't ya tell Henry,
    E
    Don't ya tell Henry,
    B
    Don't ya tell Henry,
    A [n.c.]         E
    Elbow's got your thigh."

                E
    Now, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,

    A-lookin' around just to see myself.
      A
    I spotted a horse and a donkey, too,
      E
    I looked for a cow and I saw me a few.

               A
    They said, "Don't ya tell Henry,
    E
    Don't ya tell Henry,
    B
    Don't ya tell Henry,
    A [n.c.]         E
    Elbow's got your thigh."

    Now, I went down to the pumphouse the other night,
    A-lookin' around, it was outa sight.
    I looked high and low for that big ol' tree,
    I did go upstairs but I didn't see nobody but me.

    I said, "Don't ya tell Henry,
    Don't ya tell Henry,
    Don't ya tell Henry,
    Elbow's got your thigh."

The following is played as an intro (minus the first bar) and between
verses. The tab is just of the one guitar that plays the same thing
every time; in addition, the most pronounced guitar plays different
licks over this background.

           A
    Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,

    I's lookin' around just to see who's born.

    I spied a little chicken down on his knees,

    I went up and yelled to him,"Please, please, please!"


    He said, "Don't ya tell Henry,

    Don't ya tell Henry,
    E
    Don't ya tell Henry,
    [n.c.]           [intro lick]
    Elbow's got your thigh."

    Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
    I's lookin' around just to see myself.
    I looked high and low, and I looked up above,
    But who did I see but the one I love.
    She said, "Now, don't ya tell Henry,

    Don't ya tell Henry,
    Don't ya tell Henry,
    Elbow's got your thigh."

    Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
    I was lookin' around, I was outa sight.
    I looked at a home, and I saw [it ain't new],
    I looked for a cow and I saw me a few.

    They said, "Don't ya tell Henry,
    Don't ya tell Henry,
    Don't ya tell Henry,
    Elbow's got your thigh."

    Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
    I's lookin' around just to see who was born.
    I saw a little chicken lie down on his knees,
    I went up and yelled to him,"Please, please, please!"

    He said, "Don't ya tell Henry,
    Don't ya tell Henry,
    Don't ya tell Henry,
    Elbow's got your thigh."
