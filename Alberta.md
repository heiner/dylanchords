The only difference between the two versions is that in Alberta \#1 the
second chord of the verses is D, whereas in Alberta \#2 it's C, and that
\#1 is in triple time and \#2 in duple.

    [1 verse instrumental between verses]

    Alberta what's on your mind
    Alberta what's on your mind
    You keep me worried and bothered
    All of the time
    Alberta what's on your mind

    Alberta don't you treat me unkind
    Alberta don't you treat me unkind
    Oh my heart is so sad
    Cause I want you so bad
    Alberta don't you treat me unkind

    Alberta let your hair hang low
    Alberta let your hair hang low
    I'll give you more gold
    Than your apron can hold
    If you'll only let your hair hang low
