Here comes Santa Claus

Here comes Santa Claus
G7 
Right down Santa Claus Lane

Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer
C              C7
Pullin' on the reins
F         D#dim    C        A7
Bells are ringin', children singin'
Dm7    G         C
All is merry and bright
   F         D#dim         C        A7
So hang your stockings and say your prayers
       Dm7         G7      C  (G C6) 
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight.
