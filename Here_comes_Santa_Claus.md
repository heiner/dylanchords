    C
    Here comes Santa Claus

    Here comes Santa Claus
    G7
    Right down Santa Claus Lane

    Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer
    C              C7
    Pullin' on the reins
    F         D#dim    C        A7
    Bells are ringin', children singin'
    Dm7    G         C
    All is merry and bright
       F         D#dim         C        A7
    So hang your stockings and say your prayers
           Dm7         G7      C  (G C6)
    'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight.

    [<span class="chorus">Here comes Santa Claus
    Here comes Santa Claus</span>]
    Right down Santa Claus Lane
    [<span class="chorus">He's got a bag that's filled with toys
    For boys and girls again</span>]
    Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle
    Oh what a beautiful sight
    So jump in bed, and cover your head
    'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight.

    Here comes Santa Claus
    [<span class="chorus">Here comes Santa Claus</span>]
    Right down Santa Claus Lane
    [<span class="chorus">He doesn't care if you're rich of poor</span>]
    for he loves you just the same
    [<span class="chorus">Santa knows that we're God's children</span>]
    and that makes everything right
    [<span class="chorus">Fill your hearts with Christmas cheer</span>]
    cause Santa Claus comes tonight.

    [Instrumental verse]

    [<span class="chorus">Here comes Santa Claus</span>]
    Here comes Santa Claus
    [<span class="chorus">Right down Santa Claus Lane</span>]
    He'll come around when the chimes ring out,
    when it's Christmas morn again.
    [<span class="chorus">Peace on earth will come to all
    If we just follow the light</span>]
    Fill your hearts with Christmas cheer
    'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight.

    [Half tempo:] [<span class="chorus">Peace on earth will come to all</span>]
    If we just follow the light
    [<span class="chorus">Let's give thanks to the Lord above</span>]
    [Regular tempo:] 'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight.
    [<span class="chorus">'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight.</span>]

    [Half tempo:] Let's give thanks to the Lord above
    'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight
    G C6
    tonight
    G C6
    tonight.
