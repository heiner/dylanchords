Highway 61 Revisited version

</h2>
    C                    Dm7
    Once upon a time you dressed so fine
        C/e                   F              G
    You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
    C                    Dm7                 C/e
    People'd call, say, "Beware doll, you're bound to fall"
        F                     G
    You thought they were all    kiddin' you
    F           G
     You used to laugh about
    F                  G
     Everybody that was hangin' out
    F         C/e  Dm7     C
     Now you don't talk so loud
    F         C/e  Dm7     C
     Now you don't seem so proud
          Dm                     F              G
    About having to be scrounging for your next meal.

                C     F G
    How does it feel
                C     F G
    How does it feel
                    C    F G
    To be without a home
                      C      F G
    Like a complete unknown
                   C       F  G
    Like a rolling stone?

    You've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
    But you know you only used to get juiced in it
    And nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street
    And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it
    You said you'd never compromise
    With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
    He's not selling any alibis
    As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
    And say do you want to make a deal?

    How does it feel
    How does it feel
    To be on your own
    With no direction home
    Like a complete unknown
    Like a rolling stone?

    You never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns
    When they all come down and did tricks for you
    You never understood that it ain't no good
    You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
    You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
    Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
    Ain't it hard when you discover that
    He really wasn't where it's at
    After he took from you everything he could steal.

    How does it feel
    How does it feel
    To be on your own
    With no direction home
    Like a complete unknown
    Like a rolling stone?

    Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
    They're drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
    Exchanging all precious gifts
    But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it babe
    You used to be so amused
    At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
    Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse
    When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose
    You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.

    How does it feel
    How does it feel
    To be on your own
    With no direction home
    Like a complete unknown
    Like a rolling stone?

This is also the live version from Isle of Wight, released on Self
Portrait, except that there is no capo, the Bm is played more like G/b
and the Am may have the character of a C/g with the a provided by the
bass (perhaps just a Am7).
