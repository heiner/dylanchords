As for the lyrics: wouldn't it be great if the official lyrics could
confirm that what he actually sings is: "You got the same ass as your
mother does"?

    C           F         F          C
    Well I'm grinding my life out, steady and sure
    C            F                  F        C
    Nothing more wretched than what I must endure
    C               F          F               C
    I'm drenched in the light that shines from the sun
    C            F             F               C
    I could stone you to death for the wrongs that you done
    Am                  Dm        Am
    Sooner or later you make a mistake,
    Am                          Dm         Am
    I'll put you in a chain that you never will break
    C        F        F        C
    Legs and arms and body and bone
    C        F          F      C
    I pay in blood, but not my own.

    Night after night, Day after day
    They strip your useless hopes away
    The more I take the more I give.
    The more I die the more I live.
    I got something in my pocket make your eyeballs swim.
    I got dogs could tear you limb from limb.
    I'm circlin' around the Southern Zone.
    I pay in blood, but not my own.

    Low cards are what I've got,
    But I'll play this hand whether I like it or not.
    I'm sworn to uphold the laws of God.
    You can put me out in front of a firing squad.
    I've been out and around with the rowdy men.
    Just like you, my handsome friend.
    My head's so hard, must be made of stone.
    I pay in blood, but not my own.

    Another politician pumping out the piss.
    Another angry beggar blowing you a kiss.
    You got the same eyes that your mother does.
    If only you could prove who your father was.
    Someone must have slipped a drug in your wine.
    You gulped it down and you crossed the line.
    Man can't live by bread alone.
    I pay in blood, but not my own.

    How I made it back home nobody knows,
    or how I survived so many blows.
    I've been thru Hell, What good did it do?
    You bastard! I'm suppose to respect you?
    I'll give you justice, I'll fatten your purse
    Show me your moral virtue first.
    Hear me holler and hear me moan.
    I pay in blood but not my own.

    You get your lover in the bed.
    Come here, I'll break your lousy head.
    Our nation must be saved and freed.
    You've been accused of murder, how do you plead?
    This is how I spend my days.
    I came to bury, not to raise.
    I'll drink my fill and sleep alone
    I play in blood, but not my own.
