Well, she's got Jet Pilot eyes from her hips on down.

All the bombardiers are trying to force her out of town.

She's five feet nine and she carries a monkey wrench.

She weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch.
       A7                                    E
She got all the downtown boys, all at her command
           B7
But you've got to watch her closely 'cause
[n.c.]                      E
she ain't no woman, she's a man
