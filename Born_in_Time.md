           G
    In the lonely night
                                  Em
    In the blinking stardust of a pale blue light
                                Am7
    You're comin' thru to me in black and white
         C       Cm      G
    When we were made of dreams.

    You're blowing down the shaky street,
    You're hearing my heart beat
    In the record breaking heat
    Where we were born in time.

                 G                   D
    Not one more night, not one more kiss,
                  C                G/b
    Not this time baby, no more of this.
                   G                     D
    Takes too much skill, takes too much will.
               G
    It's too revealing.
                  G                  D
    You came, you saw, just like the law
                C                     G/b
    You married young, just like your ma,
                  G                  Am
    You tried and tried, you made me slide
                D
    You left me reelin'
    G/b           C
    with this feelin'.

    On the rising curve
    Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
    You won't get anything you don't deserve
    Where we were born in time.

    You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
    You hang the flame, you'll pay the price.
    Oh babe, that fire
    Is still smokin'.
    You were snow, you were rain
    You were striped, you were plain,
    Oh babe, truer words
    Have not been spoken
    or broken.

    In the hills of mystery,
    In the foggy web of destiny,
    You can have what's left of me,
    Where we were born in time.

    In the lonely night
                         C#m
    In the stardust of a pale blue light
                      F#m7
    I think of you in black and white
         Am              E
    When we were made of dreams.

    I walk alone through the shakin' street,
    Listening to my heart beat
    In the record breaking heat
    When we were born in time.

    E           B'
    Just when I knew
             A'             E
    you were gone, you came back
                B'
    Just when I knew
               E
    It was for certain
             E              B'
    You were high, you were low
             A'         E
    You were so easy to know
                    F#m7              B'
    Oh babe, now is time to raise the curtain
        A'
    I'm hurtin'.

    On the rising curve
    Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
    I took you close and got what I deserved
    When we were born in time.

    Just when I knew
    who to thank, you went blank
    And just when the whole
    fires was smokin'
    You were snow, you were rain
    You were stripes, you were plain
    Oh babe, truer words
    Have not been spoken
    or broken.

    In the hills of mystery,
    In the foggy web of destiny,
    I think of you from deep inside of me,
    When we were born in time.

    On the rising curve
    Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,

    When we were born in time.

    [2nd times intro]

    You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
    You hung the flame, then you paid the price.
    Oh babe, and that fire
    It's still smokin'.
    You were snow, you were rain
    You were striped, Lord, and you were plain,
    Oh baby, truer words
    Have never been spoken
    or broken.

    In the hills of mystery,
    In the foggy web of destiny,
    You can have what's left of me,
    Where we were born in time.
