----
The riff between the verses is suspiciously similar to the thing in the refrain of “Like a Rolling Stone”.

The lyrics differ slightly from the official lyrics at [http://bobdylan.com/songs/legionnaire.html bobdylan.com]

     A                     D           E                A         D  E
Some say it was radiation,  some said: acid on the microphone
    A                             D                E                      A      D  E
And some say it was a combination   of things that turned their hearts to stone
    D                                       E
But whatever it was, it drove them to their knees
E7                     |: A . . .  D . . .  E . . . | . . . .  :|
Oh, that Legionnaire's disease

I wish I had a dollar for everyone that died within that year
Got 'em grabbed by the collar, and plenty a maiden shed a tear
Now beneath my heart, it sure put on a squeeze,
Oh, that Legionnaire's disease
It was Legionnaire's disease

Granddad fought in a revolutionary war, father in the War of 1812
Uncle fought down in Vietnam and then he fought a war all by himself
But whatever it was, it hit him like a tree
Oh, that Legionnaire's disease
It was Legionnaire's disease
It was Legionnaire's disease
It was Legionnaire's disease</pre>
