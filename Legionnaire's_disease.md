The riff between the verses is suspiciously similar to the thing in the
refrain of “Like a Rolling Stone”.

The lyrics differ slightly from the official lyrics at

         A                     D           E                A         D  E
    Some say it was radiation,  some said: acid on the microphone
        A                             D                E                      A      D  E
    And some say it was a combination   of things that turned their hearts to stone
        D                                       E
    But whatever it was, it drove them to their knees
    E7                     |: A . . .  D . . .  E . . . | . . . .  :|
    Oh, that Legionnaire's disease

    I wish I had a dollar for everyone that died within that year
    Got 'em grabbed by the collar, and plenty a maiden shed a tear
    Now beneath my heart, it sure put on a squeeze,
    Oh, that Legionnaire's disease
    It was Legionnaire's disease

    Granddad fought in a revolutionary war, father in the War of 1812
    Uncle fought down in Vietnam and then he fought a war all by himself
    But whatever it was, it hit him like a tree
    Oh, that Legionnaire's disease
    It was Legionnaire's disease
    It was Legionnaire's disease
    It was Legionnaire's disease
