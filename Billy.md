Several verses instrumental intro

            G                     C/g    G
    There's guns across the river aimin' at ya
    G                          C/g     G
    Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch ya
    C                                   G
    Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get ya
    D                                   G
    Billy, they don't like you to be so free.

    Campin' out all night on the veranda
    Dealin' cards 'til dawn in the hacienda
    Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send ya
    Billy, don't you turn your back on me.

    Playin' around with some sweet señorita
    Into her dark hallway she will lead ya
    To the shadows of the mesa she will greet ya
    Billy, you're so far away from home.

As above, but capo 2nd fret (sounding key A major)

    There's guns across the river, like to pound you
    Lawman on your trail like to surround you
    Bounty hunters dancin' all around you
    Billy, they don't like you to be so free.

    Campin' out all night on the veranda
    Walkin' the streets down by the hacienda
    Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send ya
    Billy, don't you turn your back on me.

    There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces
    Bullet holes and rifles in their cases
    There's always one more notch and four more aces
    Billy, and you're playin' all alone.

    Playin' around with some sweet señorita
    Into her dark chamber she will greet ya
    In the shadows of the mesa she will lead ya
    Billy, and you're goin' all alone.

    They say that Pat Garrett's got your number
    So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
    If every little sound just might be thunder
    Thunder from the barrel of his gun.

    There's always another stranger sneakin' glances
    Some trigger-happy fool willin' to take chances
    And some old whore from San Pedro to make advances
    Advances on your spirit and your soul.

    The businessmen from Taos want you to go down
    So they've hired Mister Garrett to force you to slow down.
    Billy, don't it make ya feel so low-down
    To be hunted by the man who was your friend?

    So hang on to your woman if you got one
    Remember in El Paso, once, you shot one.
    Up in Santa Fe you bought one
    Billy, you been runnin' for so long.

    Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
    Way down in some Tularosa alley,
    Maybe in the Rio Pecos valley
    Billy, you're so far away from home.
    Billy, you're so far away from home.
    Billy, you're so far away from home.

</h2>
    Spend the night with some sweet señorita
    Into her dark hallway she will lead ya
    In some lonesome shadow she might greet ya
    Billy, you're so doggone far away from home.

    They say that Pat Garrett's got your number
    Sleep with one eye open when you slumber
    Every little sound just might be thunder
    Thunder from the barrel of his gun.

    Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
    Drinkin' in some bar to hide your sorrow
    Spendin' the time that you borrow
    Figuring a way to get back home.

BD: Was that any good?  
Producer: Pretty good, Bob. What happened, you hit the mike twice, I
guess when you were movin' around out there, and we had a couple of
clunks on it.  
BD: Hm. That's too bad.

“Turkey II or Tom Turkey”

</h2>
Capo 2nd fret

Loong intro, playing around with the following riff, first without any
sense of rhythm whatsoever:

    |--------------------------3---
    |--0-1---3--5--3----1--0---0---
    |--------------------------0---
    |--0-2---3--5--3----2--0---0---
    |--------------------------2---
    |--------------------------3---

then eventually settling into this rhythm:

      :   .   .   .     :   .   .   .
    |-----------------|-----------------|
    |-0-1-----3-------|-5---3---1-0-----|
    |-----------------|-----------------|
    |-0-2-----3-----5-|-----3---2-0-----|
    |-----------------|-----------------|
    |-----------------|-----------------|

Before segueing into this strumming pattern:

      G       C/g      G7'      Am7
      :   .   .   .     :   .   .   .
    |-3-3---3-3-------|---0---0-0-0-0-0-|
    |-0-0---0-1-------|---3---3-1-1-1-1-|
    |-0-0---0-0-------|---0---0-0-0-0-0-|
    |-0-0---0-2-------|-3-----3-2-2-2-2-|
    |-2-2---2-0-------|-0-------0-0-0-0-|
    |-3-3---3-3-------|-----------------|

or some variation of it, frequently with a prominent place for the open
A string from the middle of the first bar.

This pattern is the background for the sung verses as well:

        G       C/g          G7'   Am7    G       C/g   G7' Am7
    The businessmen from Taos want you to go down
               G    C/g            G7'       Am7    G         C/g G7' Am7
    So they've hired Mister Garrett to force you to slow down.
    C                               G       C/g  G7' Am7
    Billy, don't it make ya feel so low-down
          D                     C        G
    To be hunted by the man who was your friend?

    So hang on to your woman if you got one
    Remember in El Paso, once, you shot one.
    Way up in Santa Fe you bought one
    Billy, don't it make you feel so bad?
