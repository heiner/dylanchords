<pre class="verse">
             C
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening, 
       G7
In the lane, snow is glistening

A beautiful sight,
 
We're happy tonight.
D9           G7           C 
Walking in a winter wonderland.
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
Gone away is the bluebird,
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song,
As we go along,                  B
Walking in a winter wonderland.
</pre>
<pre class="refrain">
E             A              E
In the meadow we can build a snowman,
E                 A            E
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
G                  C                    G
He'll say: Are you married?  We'll say: No man, 
    A7             D7                 G7
But you can do the job when you're in town.
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, 
The plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
</pre>
<pre class="refrain">
In the meadow we can build a snowman,
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
Until the other kids all knock him down.
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
When it snows, ain't it filling,
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
</pre>
