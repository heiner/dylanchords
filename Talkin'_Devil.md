    ["This is all about what the devil is,
    some people say that there's no devil."]

    G

         G                   C
    Well sometimes you can't see him so good
            D
    When he hides his head neath a snow white hood
     /f# G                      C
    An'  rides to kill with his face well hid
            D
    An' then goes home to his wife an' kids.

    Wonder if his kids know who he is?

    /f# |G . . /a-b | C . /b-c | D . . /e-f# | G

    Well he wants you to hate, he wants to fear
    He wants you to fear somethin' that's not even there.
    He'll give you his hate an' he'll give you his lies
    He'll give you the weapons to run out an' die
    An' you give him your soul.

    ["That's just two verses to it."]
