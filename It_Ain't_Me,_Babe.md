           D'       C
    Go 'way from my window
    D'                       G
    Leave at your own chosen speed
        D'              C
    I'm not the one you want, babe
        D'              G
    I'm not the one you need
        Bm7'               Am7
    You say you're lookin' for someone
                Bm7'            Am7
    Who's never weak but always strong
          Bm7'           Am
    To protect you an' defend you
            Bm7'             Am
    Whether you are right or wrong
        C                          D
    Someone to open each and every door
                 G
    But it ain't me, babe
    C       D            G
    No, no, no, it ain't me babe
             C         D       G
    It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.

    Go lightly from the ledge, babe
    Go lightly on the ground
    I'm not the one you want, babe
    I will only let your down
    You say you're lookin' for someone
    Who will promise never to part
    Someone to close his eyes for you
    Someone to close his heart
    Someone who will die for you an' more
    But it ain't me, babe
    No, no, no, it ain't me babe
    It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.

    Go melt back in the night
    Everything inside is made of stone
    There's nothing in here moving
    An' anyway I'm not alone
    You say you're looking for someone
    Who'll pick you up each time you fall
    To gather flowers constantly
    An' to come each time you call
    A lover for you life an' nothing more
    But it ain't me, babe
    No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
    It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.

Live version, 2004

</h2>
Based on the version from March 6, 2004

Capo 1st fret (sounding key Db major)

Chord suggestions:

    Em         022003
    C          x32013
    Fadd9      xx3213  or  x33563
    G7add11    xx0013  or  x55503
    F6         13x231
    G11        3x3211

These are merely suggestions how to reproduce the full band sound on one
guitar. All the chords in the chorus part could be played differently.
