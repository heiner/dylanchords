    Em
    A worried man with a worried mind
    Am
    No one in front of me and nothing behind
    Em                                               B7
    There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne
    Em
    Got white skin, got assassin's eyes
    Am
    I'm looking up into the sapphire tempered skies
        Em                           B7   Em
    I'm well dressed, waiting on the last train
    C                               B7          Em
    Standin' on the gallows with my head in the noose
    C                                              B7
    Any minute now I'm expectin' all hell to break loose 

    Em
    People are crazy and times are strange
        Am
    I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range
    Em                   B7          Em
    I used to care but - things have changed. 

    This place ain't doin' me any good
    I'm in the wrong town, I should've been in Hollywood
    Just for a second there I thought I saw something move
    Gonna take dancin' lessons, do the jitterbug rag
    Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag
    Only a fool in here would think he got anythin' to prove
    Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too
    Don't get up gentlemen, I'm only passing through

    People are crazy and times are strange
    I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range
    I used to care but - things have changed. 

    I've been walkin' forty miles of bad road
    If the Bible is right the world will explode
    I'm tryin' to get as far away from myself as I can
    Some things are too hot to touch
    The human mind can only stand so much
    You can't win with a losing hand
    Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet
    Puttin' her in a wheelbarrow and wheelin' her down the street

    People are crazy and times are strange
    I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range
    I used to care but - things have changed. 

    I hurt easy, I just don't show it
    You can hurt someone and not even know it
    The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity
    Gonna get lowdown, gonna fly high
    All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie
    I'm in love with a woman that don't even appeal to me
    Mr. Jinx and miss Lucy they jumped in a lake
    I'm not that eager to make a mistake

    People are crazy and times are strange
    I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range
    I used to care but - things have changed.
