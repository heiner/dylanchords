Tabbed and transcribed by Eyolf Ã˜strem

The words are absolutely not clear. Brackets mean that I can't hear what
he's singing, and whatever is within them is only an approximation to
the sounds I hear, just to have *something* there to sing. Words outside
the brackets are slightly more certain, but only slightly.

At least the chords are clear.
