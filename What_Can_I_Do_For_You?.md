Words and Music by Bob Dylan  
Released on [Saved](/wiki/Saved (Album) "wikilink") (1980)  
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

Capo 3rd fret (original key Eb major).

I have for some reason transcribed the final harp solo. You can find it
[<http://dylanchords.info/23_saved/whatcan_harp_solo.htm> here]. (Eb
harp, straight. The transcription is in C major). It is far from
optimized for screen viewing, not at all, but you can save the image and
print it out if/when you want to recreate Dylan's most glorious moment
as a harpist.  
[There's also a [midi
file](http://www.dylanchords.com/23_saved/WHATCAN.mid), not to listen
to, but to insert into the program “Harping” (if you use Windows), which
you can download from
[<http://www.freeyellow.com/members6/harping/>](http://www.freeyellow.com/members6/harping/).

    C   Am   F                   G
    You have given everything to me.
               F  F/g  C
    What can I do for You?
    C   Am   F                G
    You have given me eyes to see.
               F  F/g  C
    What can I do for You?

    Am               C/g             F               C/e
    Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
    Am          G               C           Dm
    Filled up a hunger that had always been denied,
    Am                  C/g                  F         C/e   Dm
    Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide
               Am           C/g          F
    And You've chosen me to be among the few.
                      C
    What can I do for You?

    You have laid down Your life for me.
    What can I do for You?
    You have explained every mystery.
    What can I do for You?

    Soon as a man is born, you know the sparks begin to fly,
    He gets wise in his own eyes and he's made to believe a lie.
    Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
    Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do.
    What can I do for You?

    You have given all there is to give.
    What can I do for You?
    You have given me life to live.
    How can I live for You?

    I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
    I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
    Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart.
    Well, I don't deserve it but I sure did make it through.
    What can I do for You?
