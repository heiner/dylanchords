Words and music Bob Dylan.  
Released on [Oh Mercy](Oh Mercy "wikilink") (1989).  
Tabbed by Jeff Kokosinski, with slight emendations by Eyolf Ã˜strem.

D' in the last line of the verses is basically a D and a G played at the
same time on different guitars. It can be emulated by playing a Dsus4
chord (xx0233).

    G
     Far away where the soft winds blow
                     C    Eb
    Far away from it all
    G
     There is a place you go
    G     D'        G
    Where teardrops fall.

    Far away in the stormy night
    Far away and over the wall
    You are there in the flickering light
    Where teardrops fall.

       C
    We banged the drum slowly

    And played the fife lowly
        G
    You know the song in my heart
           C
    In the turning of twilight

    In the shadows of moonlight
            Cm                     D
    You can show me a new place to start.

    I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup
    Strippin' away at it all
    Thinking of you when the sun comes up
    Where teardrops fall.

    By rivers of blindness
    In love and with kindness
    We could hold up a toast if we meet
    To the cuttin' of fences
    To sharpen the senses
    That linger in the fireball heat.

    Roses are red violets are blue
    And time is beginning to crawl
    I just might have to come to see you
    Where teardrops fall.
