Performed by Bob Dylan in Joliette, Quebec, July 31 1989 (a one-off).  
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem and Jamie Lovinger

On my tape (thanks, Jamie), it sounds as if he actually plays it in F\#
major. On the other hand, the final chord sounds very much like a G
shape chord, which is also much easier to play. I append a version in G
major at the end.

The lyrics are full of blanks – the word within brackets are not really
meaningful suggestions, just words that sound like what he's singing,
mainly to have something to place the chords on...

    F#       A#m B       F#
    Pity the man got one arm
    F#       A#m          B        (F#  first verse only)
    pity the woman that's lost her charm
    F#    /a# C# D#m B             (first verse: ...D#m C#...)
    Don't you pi-ty  me
    F# /a# C# D#m  B   F#
    Don't     pity me

    Pity the child out in the cold
    Pity the woman &lt;that back one time let go&gt;
    Don't pity me
    Don't pity me

    B
    You got a &lt;little better&gt;

    &lt;playin' with me&gt; or &lt;it's plain to see&gt;
    G#                C#
    So don't you pity me.

    Pity the angel, got no way to stay
    Pity the &lt;stranger or dancers&gt; getting old and grey
    Don't pity me
    Don't pity me

    You got a &lt;little better&gt;
    &lt;If you're playin' with me&gt; or &lt;it's plain to see&gt;
    So don't you pity me.

    Pity the man got one arm
    pity the woman that's lost her charm
    Don't pity me
    Don't pity me
