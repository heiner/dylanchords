          C       G               C
    I was thinking of a series of dreams
          C      G                C
    Where nothing comes up to the top
         C    G                      C
    Everything stays down where it's wounded
        C                    F
    And comes to a permanent stop
           C
    Wasn't thinking of anything specific
                                               F
    Like in a dream, when someone wakes up and screams
    C
    Nothing too very scientific
                 G               C
    Just thinking of a series of dreams

    Thinking of a series of dreams
    Where the time and the tempo fly
    And there's no exit in any direction
    'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes
    Wasn't making any great connection
    Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme
    Nothing that would pass inspection
    Just thinking of a series of dreams

    Am          F                C
    Dreams where the umbrella is folded
    Am  F                 C
    Into the path you are hurled
            Am       F                    C
    And the cards are no good that you're holding
      C                         G
    Unless they're from another world

    In one, numbers were burning
    In another, I witnessed a crime
    In one, I was running, and in another
    All I seemed to be doing was climb
    Wasn't looking for any special assistance
    Not going to any great extremes
    I'd already gone the distance
    Just thinking of a series of dreams

Outtake from the [Oh Mercy!](Oh Mercy! "wikilink") sessions (1989).

    I was thinking of a series of dreams
    Where nothing comes up to the top
    Everything stays down where it's wounded
    And comes to a permanent stop
    Wasn't thinking of anything specific
    Like in a dream, when someone wakes up and screams
    Nothing too very scientific
    Just thinking of a series of dreams

    Thinkin of a series of dreams
    where the middle and the bottom drop out
    and you're walking out of the darkness
    and into the shadows of doubt
    wasn't going to any great trouble
    You'd believe in it's whatever it seems
    nothing too heavy to burst the bubble
    Just thinking of a series of dreams.

    Thinking of a series of dreams
    Where the time and the tempo drag
    Suddenly the gate is thrown open
    and you're left there holding the bag
    Wasn't making any great connection
    Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme
    Nothing that would pass inspection
    I's just thinking of a series of dreams

    Dreams where the umbrella is folded
    Into the path you are hurled
    And the cards are no good that you're holding
    Unless they're from another world

    In one, the surface was frozen
    In another, I witnessed a crime
    In one, I was running, and in another
    All I seemed to be doing was climb
    Wasn't looking for any special assistance
    Not going to any great extremes
    I'd already gone the distance
    Just thinking of a series of dreams
