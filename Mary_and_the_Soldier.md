    C                     G
     Come all you lads of high renown
               F                    C
    That would hear of a fair young maiden
        C              G
    She roved out on a summer's day
           F                    C
    For to view the soldiers parading
         C          G             F         Am   \g
    They marched so bold and they looked so gay
    F                             C
     Their colours flying and the bands did play
       C            G    C      G
    It caused young Mary for to say
         F                   C
    I'll wed you, my gallant soldier

    She viewed the soldiers on parade
    And as they stood their leisure
    Mary to herself did say
    At last I've found my treasure
    But oh how cruel my parents must be
    Banishing my darling so far from me
    Well I'll leave them all and I'll go with thee
    My bold and undaunted soldier

    Oh Mary dear, your parents' love
    I pray don't be unruly
    When you're in a foreign land
    Believe me you'll rue it surely
    Perhaps in battle I might fall
    From a shot from an angry cannonball
    And you so far from your daddy's hall
    Be advised by a gallant soldier

    And I have fifty guineas in [...] gold
    Likewise a heart that's blinder
    And I'd leave them all and I'll go with you
    My bold and undaunted soldier
    So don't say no, but let me go
    And I will face the daring foe
    We'll march together to and fro
    I'll wed you, my gallant soldier

    And when he saw her loyalty
    And Mary so true-hearted
    He said: My darling, married we'll be
    And nothing but death will part us
    And when we're in some foreign land
    I'll guard you, darling, with my right hand
    Hopes that God might stand a friend
    To Mary and her gallant soldier
