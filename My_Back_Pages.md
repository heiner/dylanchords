This is noted with a <nowiki>*</nowiki>).

He didn't seem to spend too much time rehearsing this song before he
went into the studio (the whole album was recorded in one
evening/night session) – he gets the first verse all wrong in the
chords, and he struggles a lot with the final lines of each
verse. I've written out the chords for the first two verses and in the
following verses deviations from the ''second'' verse.

Capo 3rd fret (original key Eb major)

<pre class="verse">
C       Am          Em
Crimson flames tied through my ears
        F        G *)   C
Rollin' high and mighty traps
C            Am      Em      C
Pounced with fire on flaming roads
      F     Em    G   *)
Using ideas as my maps
       F       Am     G *)        C
"We'll meet on edges, soon," said I
Am                  F G
Proud 'neath heated brow
        C             Am    C
Ah, but I was so much older then
    F       G *)      C       G *)
I'm younger than that now.

C            Am    Em
Half-cracked prejudice leaped forth
     F        G *)     C
"Rip down all hate," I screamed
C         Am      Em
Lies that life is black and white
F                      G  *)
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed
  Am              Em
Romantic facts of musketeers
    F                  G
Foundationed deep, somehow
        C     Am      Em    F
Ah, but I was so much older then
    G *)              C
I'm younger than that now.

Girls' faces formed the forward path
From phony jealousy
To memorizing politics
Of ancient history
Flung down by corpse evangelists
Unthought of, thought, somehow
        C             F     C
Ah, but I was so much older then
    F       G *)      C
I'm younger than that now.

A self-ordained professor's tongue
Too serious to fool
Spouted out that liberty
Is just equality in school
"Equality," I spoke the word
As if a wedding vow
        C             Am
Ah, but I was so much older then
    F       G *)      C
I'm younger than that now.

In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand
At the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing not that I'd become my enemy
In the instant that I preach
   Am                  F      C
My existence led by confusion boats
Am          Em       G *)
Mutiny from stern to bow
        C     Am      F     C
Ah, but I was so much older then
    G       *)        C
I'm younger than that now.

Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats
Too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinking
I had something to protect
Good and bad, I define these terms
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow
        C     Am      F     C
Ah, but I was so much older then
    G       *)        C
I'm younger than that now.
