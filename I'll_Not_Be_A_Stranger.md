         C                        F
    I'll not be a stranger when I get to that city;
          C                        G
    I'm acquainted with folks over there.
                C
    There'll be friends there to greet me,
                F
    There'll be loved ones to meet me
           C             G         C
    At the gates of that city four square.

                G
    Through the years, through the tears,
            C
    They've gone one by one.
                G
    But they'll wait at the gate
      C
    Until my race is run.
         C                        F
    I'll not be a stranger when I get to that city
          C             G          C
    I'm acquainted with folks over there.

    C . . G . . C . . | . . .

    I'll not be a stranger when I get to that city;
    I've a home on the streets paved with gold.
    I'll feel right at home there
    In that beautiful somewhere
    With the loved ones whose memory I hold.

    Through the years, through the tears,
    They've gone one by one.
    But they'll wait at the gate
    Until my race is run.
    I'll not be a stranger when I get to that city
    I'm acquainted with folks over there.

    I'll not be a stranger when I get to that city;
    There'll be no lonely days over there.
    There'll be no stormy weather
    But a great time together
    On the streets of that city four square.

    Through the years, through the tears,
    They've gone one by one.
    But they'll wait at the gate
    Until my race is run.
    I'll not be a stranger when I get to that city
    I'm acquainted with folks over there.
