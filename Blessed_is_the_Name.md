Written by Bob Dylan  
Performed during the 1979-80 gospel tours.  
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem (but see alternate lyric transcriptions below)

Ironically, this is probably the song with which Dylan has made the most
energetic attempts at a sing-along kind of rapport with the audience,
but – it doesn't really work, does it...?  
The lyrics for the verses – well, I made an attempt. The transcriptions
below are a mixture of phonetic and semantic. I welcome corrections, as
always.

    When he move his face upon the water
    Sit up high on a throne
    Like him there is no other
    He's God all by himself alone

    Well to the just he will be faithful
    [let it rain fire and] brimstone down
    But he did not destroy Sodom and Gomorrah
    Till Lot was safely out of the town

    19/11 '79

    When he move his face upon the water
    Sit up high on a throne
    With him there is no other
    He's God all by himself alone

    Well to the just he will be faithful
    [hittin' on/he won't] drive you out of town
    But he did not destroy Sodom and Gomorrah
    Till Lot was safely out of the town

    20/11 '79

    When he move his face upon the water
    Sit up high on a throne
    Like him there is no other
    He's God all by himself alone

    Way back down in the days of Noah
    He'd drive you out of the town
    But he did not destroy Sodom and Gomorrah
    Till Lot was safely out of the town

    21/11 '79

    Well [...]
    Sit up high on a throne
    He will not share his glory
    He's God all by himself alone

    [Well jumpin'] in the days of Noah
    [sending] fire and brimstone down
    But he did not destroy Sodom and Gomorrah
    Till Lot was safely out of the town

    [Well in Eden on] the days of power
    King on his own time clock
    Like him there is no other
    And, hey, he will not be mocked

    16/1 '80

    When he move his face upon the water
    Sit up high on a throne
    Like him there is no other
    He's God all by himself alone

    Well, in the time by the days of Noah
    [...] the dark
    But not one drop of water fell
    Till Noah was safely in the ark

    23/1 '80

    When he move his face upon the water
    Sit up high on a throne
    Like him there is no other
    He's God all by himself alone

    Listen, back in the days of Noah
    [... faithful of the/after] dark
    But not one drop of water fell
    Till Noah was safely in the ark

    Blessed is the name of the Lord forever
    Wisdom and might are His

    Well He moved His face on the water
    He sits up high on the throne
    Like Him there is no other
    He is God all by Himself alone

    ...
    ...
    ... singing the blues
    And He can renew your mind

    Well He ... upon the peoples
    ... He's got His own time clock
    He will not share His glory
    And He will not be mocked

    Way back in the days of Noah
    They found Him faithful at the dock
    Remember not one drop of water fell
    Til Noah was safely in the ark

    Well He always will forewarn you
    Before He rains fire and brimstone down
    He did not destroy Sodom and Gomorrah
    Until Lot was safely out of town

    He made the mountains
    He made the sea
    He made the way of salvation
    for you and me
