    Bm           Bm/a G    F#
    Sometime she said  I'm slow
    Bm            Bm/a             G           F#
     She said it about me but it's too soon to know
    Bm         Bm/a     G         F#
    Don't mind leaving, wondering why
    Bm [n.c.]
    Whosoever told it, told a dirty lie

    Well, I'll tell you one more to
    Take what is you with you when you go
    Now I'll tumble, tumble and die
    Whosoever told it, told a dirty lie

    G
    Already seen your dirty mate
    Bm
    Sure find it harder to concentrate
    G
    I'll be beloved, times too slow
    F#                                  G        F#
    But make sure you take her with you when you go

    I'll love it and leave it, the sun go down
    Pray for the rain for miles around
    I'll never leave it to wonder why
    Whosoever told you, told a dirty lie

    [instrumental verses]

    Oh, they time you and I'm telling you
    I'd be watching, baby no matter what you do
    And I'll leave alone, you're far too slow
    Just make sure you take her with you when you go

    I want to leave, my feet's soaking wet
    I long to leave but I ain't found you yet
    And I know baby, telling you why
    Whosoever told me, told a dirty lie
