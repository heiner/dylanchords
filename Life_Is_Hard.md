Some playing suggestions:

1.  The chords in the beginning of the verses can be expanded to follow
    `   the melody:`  
    `Ebmaj7 . . Eb6 | Dm7 . Eaug E `  
    `   `

2.  The record has the chromatic descent beginning at ‘I'm always
    `   …' played both in the bass line and in a higher`  
    `   register. It is probably best to choose one of them;`  
    `   see chord suggestions below.`  
    `   `

3.  The chords to that descent could be conceived of (and played)
    `   either as notated below, or as ``Am Ammaj7 C/g D9/f#``.`

Chords:

    Ebmaj7     xx1333 or x65333
    Ammaj7     x02110 or 4x2210
    Am7/g      x02010 or 3x2210
    Am6/f#     x04210 or 202210 (or D9/f#: 200210)

    Ebmaj7
     The evening winds are still
    Dm7            E7
     I've lost the way and will
    Am              D7
     Canât tell you where they went
    Gm           C7
     I just know what they meant
    Am         Ammaj7/g#
    Iâm always on my guard
    Am7/g     Am6/f#
    Admitting life is hard
    Gm  C7       F
     Without you near me

    The friend you used to be
    So near and dear to me
    You slipped so far away
    Where did we go astray
    I passed the old school yard
    Admitting life is hard
    Without you near me

    Bb              A7
     Ever since the day
        Dm            D7
    The day you went away
    Gm             C7        F
    I felt that emptiness so wide
    Bb                  A7
    I donât know what's wrong or right
      Dm               D7
    I just know I need strength to fight
    Gm           C7                  Am
     Strength to fight that world outside

    Since we've been out of touch
    I haven't felt that much
    From day to barren day
    My heart stays locked away
    I walk the boulevard
    Admitting life is hard
    Without you near me

    The sun is sinking low
    I guess it's time to go
    I feel a chilly breeze
    In place of memories
    My dreams are locked and barred
    Admitting life is hard
    Without you near me

    Bb    A7    Dm    D7 

    Gm   C7      F
     Without you near me
