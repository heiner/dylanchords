Capo 1st fret (sounding key Gb major)

Great tune, great singing (especially the

0h1 on the 6th string at the beginning and here and there else.

    Big ships sailin'
    Slaves all chained and bound
    Heading for another land
    that some cat says he's up and found
    Lord have mercy
    What You gonna do
    About the people who been prayin' to You
    They got men makin' laws that destroy other men
    makin' money God, it's a dog-gone sin
    Oh Lord, You got to help us find a way.

    Freedom for the stallion
    Freedom for the mare and the colt
    Freedom for the baby child
    Who's not grown old enough to vote
    Lord have mercy
    What You gonna do
    About the people that are prayin' to You
    Well, when I look Into my mind
    It's the truth that I find
    Oh Lord, You gotta help us find a way.

    Freedom for the stallion
    Freedom for the mare and the colt
    Freedom for the baby child
    Who has not grown old enough to vote
    Lord have mercy
    What You gonna do
    About the people that are prayin' to You
    Well, when I look Into my mind
    It's the truth that I find
    Oh Lord, You gotta help us find a way.

“Allright, what do you think of that?”
