    E
    Broken lines broken strings

    Broken threads broken springs
    A
    Broken idols broken heads
    E
    People sleeping in broken beds
    B
    Ain't no use jiving
    A
    Ain't no use joking
    E
      Everything is broken.

    Broken bottles broken plates
    Broken switches broken gates
    Broken dishes broken parts
    Streets are filled with broken hearts
    Broken words never meant to be spoken
    Everything is broken.

    B
    Seem like every time you stop and turn around
    A
    Something else just hit the ground

    Broken cutters broken saws
    Broken buckles broken laws
    Broken bodies broken bones
    Broken voices on broken phones
    Take a deep breath feel like you're chokin'
    Everything is broken.

    Everytime you leave and go off someplace
    Things fall to pieces in my face

    Broken hands on broken ploughs
    Broken treaties broken vows
    Broken pipes broken tools
    People bending broken rules
    Hound dog howling bullfrog croaking
    Everything is broken.

Lyrics transcribed by Dag B

    Broken nights, broken days,
    Broken leaves on broken trees,
    Broken treaties, broken vows,
    Broken hands on broken plows.
    Ain't no use runnin', honey,
    Ain't no use jokin'
    Nothing's workin'
    Everything is broken.

    Broken lives, hangin' by a thread,
    Broken bones in a broken bed,
    Broken mirror, broken chair,
    Broken roads, goin' nowhere.
    Broken words never meant to be spoken,
    Can't help it, honey,
    Everything broken.

    I send you roses once from a heart that was truly grieved
    Send you roses someone else must have received

    Broken clock, on a broken wall
    Broken voices in a broken hall
    Broken beginnings, broken ends
    Streets are filled with broken friends
    Take a deep breath, baby, feel like you're chokin',
    Tell me the truth now,
    Everything broken.

    Seen James Dean in a picture once, comin' in from the cold
    Say, geez, I hope I look that good, if I get to be that old

    Broken flesh on a broken floor,
    Broken key, for a broken door
    Broken idols, broken heroes,
    Broken numbers, addin' up to zeroes
    Hound dog's howling, bull frog's croakin',
    It ain't easy, baby,
    Everything broken.
