Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

* * * * *

Capo 1st fret, based on the left guitar (sounding key Bb major)

The Amaj7 thing between the verses is probably better played with a
chord sequence like x06650 – x04430 on a single guitar. For the
variation in the outro, the descent can start higher:

      Amaj7             Bm7/a             Amaj7             Bm7/a
      :   .   .   .     :   .   .   .     :   .   .   .     :   .   .   .

           A
    Oh the evening train is rolling
         D
    All along the homeward way
           A
    All my hopes are over the horizon
           A           E     A
    All my dreams have gone away
        A
    The hillside darkly shaded
          D
    Stars fall from above
            A
    All the joys of earth have faded
        A         E          A
    The night's untouched by love

         D
    I'll be here 'til tomorrow
      A
    Beneath a shroud of grey
         D
    I pretend I'm free of sorrow
       A              E
    My heart is miles away

        A
    The dead bells are ringing
       D
    My train is overdue
            A
    To your memory I'm clinging
      A      E          A
    I can't escape from you

      Amaj7       D             A        (E)  A

                                       Well I . . .

    Well I hear the sound of thunder
    Roaring loud and long
    Sometimes you've got to wonder
    God knows I've done no wrong
    You've wasted all your power
    You threw out the Christmas pie
    Now you're withering like a flower
    You'll play the fool and die

    I'm neither sad nor sorry
    I'm all dressed up in black
    I fought for fame and glory
    You tried to break my back

    In the far off sweet forever
    The sunshine peeking through
    We should have walked together
    I can't escape from you

    I cannot grasp the shadows
    That gather near the door
    Rain falls round my window
    I wish I'd seen you more
    The path is ever-winding
    The stars they never age
    The morning light is blinding
    All the world's a stage

    Should be the time of gladness
    Happy faces everywhere
    The mystery of madness
    Is propagating in the air

    I don't like the city
    Not like some folks do
    Isn't it a pity
    I can't escape from you

    We ploughed the fields of heaven
    Right down to the end
    I hope I can be forgiven
    If any words of mine offend
    All our days were splendid
    They were simple, they were plain
    It never should have ended
    I should have kissed you in the rain

    I've been thinking things all over
    All the moments full of grace
    The primrose and the clover
    Your ever-changing face

    Can't help looking at you
    You made love with god-knows-who
    Never found a girl to match you
    I can't escape from you
