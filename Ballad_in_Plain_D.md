Words and music Bob Dylan  
Released on [Another Side Of Bob
Dylan](Another Side Of Bob Dylan "wikilink") (1964)  
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

* * * * *

Probably Dylan's most misnamed song, since it's not really in plain D,
but in plain C with a capo on the 2nd fret (which of course turns it
into D, but hardly “plain”, from a guitar perspective, anyway)

The F chord at the end of lines 1 and 3 is sometimes played, sometimes
not – it's just an embellishment, really.

What is played C/g-G7 in the last line of the first verse, is in most
subsequent verses replaced with a G-G6-G7 turn.

Other deviations from the chords of the first verse are noted.

Chords:

    G     320003
    G6    322003
    G7    323003
    C/g   332010
    Bb/d  xx0331   (in some verses he plays x00331, probably an error
                    but quite nice)

    G-G7 C            Am        C/g     (F) C
    I    once loved a girl, her skin it was bronze
                            Am            Bb/d          F
    With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn
      C           Am           C/g    (F) C
    I courted her proudly, but now she is gone
                C/g          G7 C     G G6 G7
    Gone as the season she's taken.

    In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
    From her mother and sister, though close did they stay
    Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day
    With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.

    Of the two sisters, I loved the young
         Am                   C/g          F
    With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one
    The constant scrapegoat, she was easily undone
    By the jealousy of others around her.

    For her parasite sister, I had no respect
    C            Am           C/g      F
    Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect
    Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
    As a crutch for her scenes and her society.

    Myself, for what I did, I cannot be excused
    The changes I was going through can't even be used
    For the lies that I told her in hopes not to lose
    The could-be dream-lover of my lifetime.

         C      Am             C/g   F           C
    With unseen consciousness, I possessed in my grip
    A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped
    Noticing not that I'd already slipped
    To a sin of love's false security.

         C           Am       F            C
    From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace
    Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
    Till the tombstones of damage read me no question but, "Please
    What's wrong and what's exactly the matter?"

    And so it did happen, like it could have been foreseen
        C          Am         Bb        F
    The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream
    At the peak of the night, the king and the queen
    Tumbled all down into pieces.

         C      Am          F          C
    "The tragic figure" her sister did shout
    "Leave her alone, God damn you, get out"
        C       Am     (Dm)    F C
    And I in my armor, turning about
    And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness.

    Beneath a bare light bulb the plaster did pound
    Her sister and I in a screaming battleground
    And she in between, the victim of sound
    Soon shattered as a child to the shadows.

           C            Am                   C
    All is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight
    I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight
    My mind it was mangled, I ran into the night
    Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.

        C              Am          F          C
    The wind knocks my window, the room it is wet
    The words to say I'm sorry, I haven't found yet
      C            Am                F          C
    I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
    Will be fully aware of how precious she is.

    [Harmonica solo verse:]

    C   Am    F    C
    C   Am    Bb/d F
    C   Am    C/g  F   C
    C   G  G6 G7   C

    G G6 G7

    Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me
         C         Em           F
    "How good, how good does it feel to be free"?
    And I answer them most mysteriously
    "Are birds free from the chains of the skyway"?

    [Harmonica:]

    Am    C/g    F       F
    C     C      G G6 G7 G7
    C
