         [n.c.]                    C    Am
    Blue moon you saw me standing alone
    Dm         G           C     Am
     Without a dream in my heart
    Dm         G          C    Am   Dm  G
     Without a love of my own.

    Blue moon you knew just what I was there for
    You heard me saying a prayer for
    Someone I really could care for.

    Dm                    G        C       Am
    Then suddenly there appeared before me
        Dm          G               C
    The only one my arms could ever hold
    Fm              Bb                Eb
    I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me"
        G                D                  G
    And when I looked my moon had turned to gold.

    Blue moon now I am no longer alone
    Without a dream in may heart
    Without a love of my own
    Without a love of my own.
