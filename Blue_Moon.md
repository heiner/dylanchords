     [n.c.]                    C    Am
Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Dm         G           C     Am
 Without a dream in my heart
Dm         G          C    Am   Dm  G
 Without a love of my own.

Blue moon you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for.

<pre class="bridge">
Dm                    G        C       Am
Then suddenly there appeared before me
    Dm          G               C
The only one my arms could ever hold
Fm              Bb                Eb
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me"
    G                D                  G
And when I looked my moon had turned to gold.
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
Blue moon now I am no longer alone
Without a dream in may heart
Without a love of my own
Without a love of my own.
