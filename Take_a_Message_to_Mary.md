                             Em
    These are the words of a frontier lad
        Am                 G
    Who lost his love when he turned bad.

     Take a message to Mary
        F              G       C
    But don't tell her where I am

    Take a message to Mary
        F             G       C
    But don't say I'm in a jam.

            Am                     Em
    You can tell her that I had to see the world
    Am               D        G
    Tell her that my ship set sail
            C         G          F        C
    You can say she'd better not wait for me
        Am                 /g Am
    But don't tell her I'm in jail
       C              G      C
    Oh don't tell her I'm in jail.

    Take a message to Mary
    But don't tell her what I've done
    Please don't mention the stagecoach
    An' the shot from a careless gun.

    You can tell her that I changed my plans
    An' cancel out the weddin' day
    But don't mention my lonely cell
    Where I'm gonna pine away
    Until my dyin' day.

    Take a message to Mary
    But don't tell all you know
    My heart is achin' for Mary
    Lord knows I miss her so.

    Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu
    Tell that I'm searchin' for gold
    You can say she'd better find someone new
    To cherish an' to hold
    Oh Lord, this cell is cold.
