     D6
    Aloha ay

    Aloha ay
     A        D6
    Aloha oha ay

                           G/d   D
    How'd ya like to spend Christmas
       B7        E7
    On Christmas Island?
             A7
    How'd ya like to spend the holiday
                    D
    Away across the sea?

                           G/d   D
    How'd ya like to spend Christmas
       B7        E7
    On Christmas Island?
             A7
    How'd ya like to hang a stocking
                           D       D7
    On a great big coconut tree?

                          G
    How'd ya like to stay up late
                       D
    Like the islanders do?
             B7       E7
    Wait for Santa to sail in
                               A7
    with your presents in a canoe

    If you ever spend Christmas
    On Christmas Island
    You will never stray, for everyday
    Your Christmas dreams come true.

    [How'd ya like to stay up late
    Like the islanders do?
    Wait for Santa to sail in
    with your presents
    In a canoe]

    If you ever spend Christmas
    On Christmas Island
    You will never stray, for everyday
    Your Christmas dreams come true.
