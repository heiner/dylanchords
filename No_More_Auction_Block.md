Trad. (arr. Bob Dylan)  
Recorded live at the Gaslight cafe, late 1962. Released on [The Bootleg
Series 1-3](/wiki/The Bootleg Series 1-3 "wikilink") (1991)  
 Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

This is reportedly the melody that Dylan used for [Blowin' in the
Wind](/wiki/Blowin' in the Wind "wikilink"). This is most evident in the
beginning of the verses and in the guitar interlude.

Capo 5th fret (sounding key F major)  
Played with fast strumming in a rather loose rhythm.

Chords:

    Csus4   x33010
    G6      322003 or 32200x
    G7      323003 or 32300x
    C/e     xx2010
