       C                   G
    To love you still, and have you not
         C          F       C
    Will destroy me   in time
           C                        G
    So I'm goin' away, where nobody knows me
        C       F           C
    And get you   off my mind

         F                  C
    I've packed my things a dozen times
          G             C    C7
    But unpack is all I do
            F                  C
    Yes I'm still in town, I'm still around
        G                  C
    And still in love with you

      F              C
    I made it to the edge of town,
    G           C
    But turned around
      F              C
    I made it to the bridge downtown
           D7*)         G                *) Mistakenly played
    But my nerve let me down                G the first time

    I try to go, but how can I leave
    When all roads lead to you
    (Yes) I'm still in town, still around
    And still in love with you

    G . . . | C . F . | C

    I made it to the edge of town,
    But turned around
    I made it to the bridge downtown
    But my nerve let me down

    I try to go, but how can I leave
    When all roads lead to you
    (Yes) I'm still in town, still around
    And still in love with you
