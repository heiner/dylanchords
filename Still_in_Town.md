   C                   G
To love you still, and have you not
     C          F       C
Will destroy me   in time
       C                        G
So I'm goin' away, where nobody knows me
    C       F           C
And get you   off my mind
</pre>

<pre class="refrain">
     F                  C
I've packed my things a dozen times
      G             C    C7
But unpack is all I do
        F                  C
Yes I'm still in town, I'm still around
    G                  C
And still in love with you
</pre>
<pre class="bridge2">
  F              C
I made it to the edge of town,
G           C
But turned around
  F              C
I made it to the bridge downtown
       D7*)         G                *) Mistakenly played
But my nerve let me down                G the first time
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
I try to go, but how can I leave
When all roads lead to you
(Yes) I'm still in town, still around
And still in love with you

G . . . | C . F . | C

<pre class="bridge2">
I made it to the edge of town,
But turned around
I made it to the bridge downtown
But my nerve let me down
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
I try to go, but how can I leave
When all roads lead to you
(Yes) I'm still in town, still around
And still in love with you
