    G
    You think you know
                     D
    The smile on her lips

    The thrill an' the touch
                 G
    Of her fingertips
                 C         G           D          C      C  G/b  Am  G
    But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.

    You think you'll find
    A heaven of bliss
    In each caress
    In each tender kiss
    But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.

    C
    You stole her love from me one day
    G
    You didn't care how it hurt me
    A7
    But you can never steal away
    D7
    Memories of what used to be.

    You think she's yours
    To have and to hold
    Someday you'll learn
    When her love grows cold
    But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
