    E                                              B
    Night after night you wander the streets of my mind
                                                          E
    Night after night, don't know what you think you will find
    E
    No place to go, nowhere to turn
    A
    Everything around you seems to burn, burn, burn
                B
    And there's never any mercy in sight,
                E
    Night after Night
    B     A     E
    Night after Night
    B     A     E
    Night after Night

    Night after Night some nuke plant will blow up the world
    Night after night another old man is in some young girl
    You look for salvation, you find none
    just another broken heart, another barrel of a gun
    Just another stick of dynamite
    Night after Night
    Night after Night
    Night after Night

    Night after Night you drop dead in your bed
    Night after Night another bottle finds a head
    Night after Night I think about cuttin' you loose
    but I just can't do it - what would be the use?
    So I'll just keep on holding you tight,
    Night after Night
    Night after Night [Night after Night after Night after Night after Night]
    Night after Night [Night after Night after Night after Night after Night]
    Night after Night [Night after Night after Night after Night after Night]
    Night after Night [Night after Night after Night after Night after Night]
