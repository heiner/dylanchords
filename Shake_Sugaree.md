    E                                 E7
    I got a secret, and I ain't gonna tell
    A                                  E
    I'm going to Heaven in a split pea shell

    A                      E         A
    Oh Lordy me, didn't we shake sugaree
    E            B       A       E
    Everything I have is down in pawn.

    I pawned my watch, and I pawned my chain
    I even tried to sell myself, but I got down so ashamed

    I've got a song to sing, and it's not very long
    I'm gonna sing it right, if it takes me all night long.

    I got a secret, and I ain't gonna tell
    I'm going to Heaven in a split pea shell.

Different version (Cotten's own?) with additional verses not sung by
Dylan

</h2>
I have a little song, won't take long  
Sing it right, once or twice  
Oh lord oh me, didn't I shake sugaree  
Everythiny I got is done in pawn (2x)

I pawned my watch, pawned my chain  
Pawned everything that was in my name

I pawned my buggy, house and cot  
Pawned everything that was on my lot

I pawned my chair, I pawned my bed  
Don't have nowhere to lay my head

I have a little secret I ain't gonna tell  
I'm goin' to heaven in a ground pea shell

I pawned my house, I've pawned my home  
Pawned everything that I own

I pawned my tobacco, I pawned my pipe  
Pawned everything that was in my sight

I know something, I ain't gonna tell  
I'm goin' to heaven and I ain't goin' to ...

I pawned my hat, I pawned my shoes  
Pawned everything that I could use

I chew my tobacco, spit my juice  
I would raise cain but it ain't no use
