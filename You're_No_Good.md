    Well, I don't know why I love you like I do
      D7                    G              C
    Nobody in the world can get along with you
                C               F                    C /b /Bb A7
    You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den
           D7                  G                    C
    I come home last night you wouldn't even let me in.
       E                               F
    Oh sometimes you're as sweet as anybody want to be
       D7                               G    (n.c.)
    Oh when you get the crazy notion of jumping all over me
              C                    F                 C /b /Bb A7
    Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied
             D7                  G                  C
    When you give me the blues I wanna lay down and die.

    I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama
    I helped you when you had no food to eat
    Now you're that kind of woman that just don't understand
    You're taking all my money and give it to another man.
    Well, you're that kind of woman makes a man lose his brains
    You're that kind of woman drives me insane
    Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied

    You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
