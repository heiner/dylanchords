Your mother says I'm a stranger 
My face you'll never see no more
But there's one promise, darling: 
I'll see you on God's golden shore.

Through this open world I'm about to ramble 
Through ice and snows, sleet and rain
I'm about to ride that morning railroad
Perhaps I'll die on that train.

I'm going back to Colorado 
The place that I started from
If I had known how bad you'd treat me honey 
I never would have come.

<h4>Version from spring tour 2002</h4>

<p>For the spring tour 2002, Dylan brought out this song again, and
played it in a version that is basically the same as the version from
<em>Oh Brother, where art thou?</em>, crossed with the start/stop
arrangement of Cold Irons Bound.<br />
The bracketed lines are sung in three-part harmony with Larry and
Charlie.<br />
The tab is based on the version from Stockholm, Apr 5, 2002. I have a
vague recollection of seeing him play it in C (chords: C, F and G) in
Oslo two days later, but I may be wrong &ndash; I had other things on my
mind. Anyway, F is the key of the version in the film, so Bob may have
copied that too (can that man never come up with an original
thought...?) (just kidding) (in case you wondered).</p>

For six long years I've been in trouble
Nor pleasure here on earth I find
For I'm bound to ride that morning railroad
Perhaps I'll die on that train

I am a man of constant sorrow

<h4>The Soggy Bottom Boys version:</h4>
<pre class="verse">
I am a man of constant sorrow 
I've seen trouble all my days 
I bid farewell to old Kentucky 
The place where I was born and raised 
(The place where he was born and raised) 

For six long years I've been in trouble 
No pleasure here on earth I found 
For in this world I'm bound to ramble 
I have no friends to help me down 
(He has no friends to help him down) 

It's fare thee well my old true lover 
I never expect to see you again 
For I'm bound to ride that northern railroad 
Perhaps I'll die upon this train 
(Perhaps he'll die upon this train) 

You can bury me in some deep valley 
For many years where I may lay 
And you may learn to love another 
While I am sleepin' in my grave 
(While he is sleepin' in his grave) 

Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger 
My face you never will see no more 
But there is one promise that is given 
I'll meet you on God's golden shore
(He'll meet you on God's golden shore)
