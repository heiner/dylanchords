    A
    When you're sad and when you're lonely

    And you haven't got a friend
           E                            A
    Just remember that death is not the end

    And all that you held sacred

    Falls down and dows not bend
           E                            A
    Just remember that death is not the end.

                  D/a  A
    Not the end,       (no, no)
                  D/a  A
    not the end        (no, no)
           E                            A
    Just remember that death is not the end.

    When you're standing on the cross-roads
    That you cannot comprehend
    Just remember that death is not the end
    And all your dreams have vanished
    And you don't know what's up the bend
    Just remember that death is not the end.

    Not the end,
    not the end
    Just remember that death is not the end.

    When the storm clouds gather round you
    And heavy rains descend
    Just remember that death is not the end
    And there's nowhere there to comfort you
    With helping hand to lend
    Just remember that death is not the end.

    Not the end,
    not the end
    Just remember that death is not the end.

           D
    Oh the tree of life is growing
              A
    Where the spirit never dies
            D
    And the bright light of salvation
              A              E
    Shines in dark and empty skies

    When the cities are on fire
    When the burning flesh of men
    Just remember that death is not the end
    And you search in vain to find
    Just one law abiding citizen
    Just remember that death is not the end.

    Not the end, not the end
    Just remember that death is not the end.
