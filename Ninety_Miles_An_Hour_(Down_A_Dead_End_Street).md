               A                        D         A
    I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun
      E                        A    Asus4 A
    A few stolen kisses and no harm was   done
               D                                    A
    Instead of stopping when we could we went right on
                     (A/c#)         D           A/c#
    Till suddenly we found that the brakes were gone.

    You belong to someone else, and I do too
    It's just crazy bein' here with you
    As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
    Going ninety miles an hour down a dead end street
    Ninety miles an hour down a dead end street.

    I didn't want to want you, but now I have no choice
    It's too late to listen to that warning voice
    All I hear is thunder of two hearts beat
    Going ninety miles an hour down a dead end street
    Ninety miles an hour down a dead end street.

    D
    You're not free to belong to me
                               A
    And you know I could never be your own
         D
    Your lips on mine are like a sweet, sweet wine
                      A             E
    But we're heading for a wall of stone.

    Warning signs are flashing ev'ry where, but we pay no heed
    'Stead of slowing down the pace, we keep a pickin' up speed
    Disaster's getting closer ev'ry time we meet
    Going ninety miles an hour down a dead end street
    Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead end street
    Well, ninety miles an hour down a dead end street.
