<pre class="verse">
A    /c#      D
Just like old Saxophone Joe
F#m                        Bm
When he's got the hogshead up on his toe
A  /c#    F#7
Oh me, oh my
Bm        E       A
Love that country pie

Listen to the fiddler play
When he's playin' 'til the break of day
Oh me, oh my
Love that country pie
</pre>

<pre class="bridge">
C#7
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon and lime
F#
  What do I care?
Bm
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin and plum
E
Call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
Saddle me up my big white goose
Tie me on 'er and turn her loose
Oh me, oh my
Love that country pie
</pre>

<pre class="bridge">
I don't need much and that ain't no lie
Ain't runnin' any race
Give to me my country pie
I won't throw it up in anybody's face
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
Shake me up that old peach tree
Little Jack Horner's got nothin' on me
Oh me, oh my
Love that country pie
</pre>
