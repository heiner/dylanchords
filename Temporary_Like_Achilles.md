    G
    Standing on your window, honey,
    C              D      G
    Yes, I've been here before.
    G
    Feeling so harmless,
        C               D      G
    I'm looking at your second door.
    D                                      G
    How come you don't send me no regards?
        G                D7
    You know I want your lovin',
                          G
    Honey, why are you so hard?

    Kneeling 'neath your ceiling,
    Yes, I guess I'll be here for a while.
    I'm tryin' to read your portrait, but,
    I'm helpless, like a rich man's child.
    How come you send someone out to have me barred?
    You know I want your lovin',
    Honey, why are you so hard?

           Em
    Like a poor fool in his prime,
                        Bm
    Yes, I know you can hear me walk,
                Em
    But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime,
    Bm              D7         D7sus4
      Or is it just solid rock?

    Well, I rush into your hallway,
    Lean against your velvet door.
    I watch upon your scorpion
    Who crawls across your circus floor.
    Just what do you think you have to guard?
    You know I want your lovin', Honey, but you're so hard.

    Achilles is in your alleyway,
    He don't want me here,
    He does brag.
    He's pointing to the sky
    And he's hungry, like a man in drag.
    How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
    You know I want your lovin',
    Honey. but you're so hard.
