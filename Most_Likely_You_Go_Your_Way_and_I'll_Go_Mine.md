    G7

    Am
      You say you love me

    And you're thinkin' of me,
                              G(7)
    But you know you could be wrong.
    Am
      You say you told me

    That you wanna hold me,
                                 G(7)
    But you know you're not that strong.
    Bm
    I just can't do what I done before,
    Am
    I just can't beg you any more.
              G(7)
    I'm gonna let you pass
        D7
    And I'll go last.
         G         Bm/f#     C/e     G
    Then time will tell just who has fell
        Am(/c)            D7
    And who's been left behind,
    n.c.                          G
    When you go your way and I go mine.

    You say you disturb me
    And you don't deserve me,
    But you know sometimes you lie.
    You say you're shakin'
    And you're always achin',
    But you know how hard you try.
    Sometimes it gets so hard to care,
    It can't be this way ev'rywhere.
    And I'm gonna let you pass,
    Yes, and I'll go last.
    Then time will tell just who has fell
    And who's been left behind,
    When you go your way and I go mine.

        Em
    The judge, he holds a grudge,
               D
    He's gonna call on you.
             Em
    But he's badly built

    And he walks on stilts,
                       D7           D7sus4
    Watch out he don't fall on you.

    You say you're sorry
    For tellin' stories
    That you know I believe are true.
    You say ya got some
    Other kinda lover
    And yes, I believe you do.
    You say my kisses are not like his,
    But this time I'm not gonna tell you why that is.
    I'm just gonna let you pass,
    Yes, and I'll go last.
    Then time will tell who fell
    And who's been left behind,
    When you go your way and I go mine.

*Before the Flood* version (live, 1974)

</h2>
Same as above, only faster, more intensive, and (in my opinion:) better,
and with the intro figure played rather like this (on Garth's organ,
though):

      G(7)
      :   .   .   .     :   .   .   .
