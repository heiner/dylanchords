Bob Dylan  
Recorded during [The Basement Tapes](/wiki/The Basement Tapes "wikilink")
sessions (1967), and released (unofficially) on the Genuine Basement
Tapes.  
Lyrics transcribed by J.W. Mahoney, with some emendations to make it
sound more like a meaningful text (which I don't think it necessarily
has to be; see [this note](http://dylanchords.info/faq.htm#Imnotthere)
for a short explanation of why).  
Here's a [different
transcription](http://dylanchords.info/17_basement/im_not_there_lyrics.htm)  
And just for the record: “(1956)” is part of the title, not the year of
writing.  
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

              G
    Well it's alright

    she'nay she's all the time in my
    F
    neighborhood
                  Am
    she cried both day and night,
                G
    I know it because it was there.

          G
    It's a milestone
              F
    but she's down on her luck,
            Am
    and she daily salutin
           G
    but to make him hard to buck,

    I bevaid ...

      C
    I believe where she stopping

    ifshe wants time to care,
        Em
    I believe that she'd look upon
      F
    deciding to care,
          Em
    and I go by the Lord
         F
    in a way she's on my way,
          G
    but I don't belong there.

    No I don't belong to her,
    I don't belong to anybody,
    she's my prize forsaken angel
    but she don't hear me cry.

    She's a long-hearted mystic
    and she can't carry on,
    when I'm there she's alright,
    but she's not, when I'm gone

    Heaven knows that the answer
    she's don't call in no-one,
    she's the way, a sailing beautiful,
    she's mine, for the one,

    and I loss a heavy tension,
    by temptation less it runs
    but she don't allah me
    but I'm not there, I'm gone.

    Now I've cried tonight
    like I cried the night before,
    and I'm knees on the hassle,
    but I dream about the door.

    So-long Jesus-saken,
    blind fate, with a tell,
    it don't hang contonation
    she's my ald fare-thee-well.

    Now when I'll treat the levee,
    I was born to love her,
    but she knows that the kingdom
    weighs so high above her,

    and I run but I race,
    but it's not too fast a sleoun,
    but I don't perceive her,
    I'm not there, I'm gone.

    Well it's all about deffusion
    That I cry for her veil,
    I don't need anybody now
    beside me to tell

    And it's all affirmation
    I recieve, but it's not,
    She's a lone-hearted beauty
    but she's gone like the spot
    if she waoun...

    Yes, she's gone like the rainbow
    that was shining yesterday
    but now she's a-home beside me
    and I'd like her to stay

    she's a bone-forsaking beauty
    and it don't trust anyone,
    and I wish I was beside her,
    but I'm not there, I'm gone.

    Well it's a too hard to stake-in,
    and I don't bart-b'lieve
    It's all bag for tebusing,
    but she's hard, too hard to leave.

    It's alone, it's a crime
    the way she moult me around
    was she told for to hate me
    by this dong fortaken clown.

    Yes I believe that it's rightful,
    oh I believe it in my mind,
    I b'told like I said when I before
    carry on the crying,

    and she's all good to told her,
    like I said, carry on,
    I wish I was there to help her,
    but I'm not there, I'm gone ...
