    G

    G             D   C        Em
     You speak to me   in sign language
                    D                   Em
    As I'm eatin' a sandwich in a small cafe
    C                G
     At a quarter to three.

    But I can't respond to your sign language.
    You're taking advantage, bringing me down
    Can't you make any sound?

    'Twas there by the bakery, surrounded by fakery
    Tell her my story, still I'm still there
    Does she know I still care?

    [instr. verse, followed by a verse sung by Dylan]

    Link Wray was playin' on a jukebox I was payin'
    For the words I was sayin' so misunderstood
    He didn't do me no good.

    You speak to me in sign language
    As I'm eatin' a sandwich in a small cafe
    At a quarter to three.

    But I can't respond to your sign language.
    You're taking advantage, bringing me down
    Can't you make any sound?
