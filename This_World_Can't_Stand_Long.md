    C
    This world can't stand that long
    F              C
    Be ready don't wait too late
    G
    You should know it can't stand long
                          C
    For it is too full of hate

    For a long time this world has stood
    Gets more wicked every day
    the maker who created it
    Surely won't let it stand this way

    This world can't stand too long
    Be ready don't wait too late
    You should know it can't stand long
    For it is too full of hate

    This world's been destroyed before
    Cause it is too full of sin
    For that very reason
    It will be destroyed again

    This world it can't stand long
    Be ready don't wait too late
    You should know it can't stand long
    For it is too full of hate

    If we only give our hearts to God
    Let him lead us by the hand
    Nothing in this world to fear
    He'll lead you across the golden sand

    This world it can't stand long
    Be ready don't wait too late
    You should know it can't stand long
    For it is too full of hate
