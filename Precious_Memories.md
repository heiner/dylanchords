Bb  .  F  .  Bb .  .  .

Bb          Eb           Bb
 As I travel down life's pathway
           C7               F
Know not what the years may hold
Bb         Eb          Bb
As I ponder hopes grow fonder
Bb        F                 Bb
 Precious memories flood my soul
</pre>

<pre class="refrain">
Bb               Eb        Bb
Precious memories how they linger

How they ever flood my soul
                Eb      Bb
In the stillness of the midnight
         F               Bb
Precious sacred scenes unfold.

Precious father loving mother
Glide across the lonely years
And old home scenes of my childhood
In fond memories appears

<pre class="refrain">
Precious memories how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious memories sacred scenes unfold.
