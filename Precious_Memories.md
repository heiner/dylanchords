    Bb  .  F  .  Bb .  .  .

    Bb          Eb           Bb
     As I travel down life's pathway
               C7               F
    Know not what the years may hold
    Bb         Eb          Bb
    As I ponder hopes grow fonder
    Bb        F                 Bb
     Precious memories flood my soul

    Bb               Eb        Bb
    Precious memories how they linger

    How they ever flood my soul
                    Eb      Bb
    In the stillness of the midnight
             F               Bb
    Precious sacred scenes unfold.

    Precious father loving mother
    Glide across the lonely years
    And old home scenes of my childhood
    In fond memories appears

    Precious memories how they linger
    How they ever flood my soul
    In the stillness of the midnight
    Precious memories sacred scenes unfold.

    Precious sacred scenes unfold.
