Capo 4th fret (Original key Ab blues)  
The recurrent chord is a shimmering Esus4 which is never really resolved
- or, for the sake of convenience, Em.

            Em
    I can't wait
    A                           Em
    Wait for you to change your mind

    It's late
    A                     Em
    I'm tryin to walk the line

    Well it's way past midnight

    And there's people all around
    A
    Some on their way up

    Some on their way down
    Em                               A
    The air burns and I'm tryin to think straight
    C                B7                    Em
    And I don't know how much longer I can wait

    I'm your man
    I've tried to recover the sweet love that we knew
    You understand
    That my heart can't go on beating without you
    Well your loveliness has wounded me
    I'm reeling from the blow
    I wish I knew what it was that keeps me loving you so
    I'm breathin' hard standin' at the gate
    And I don't know how much longer I can wait

    Skies are gray
    I'm looking for anything that will bring a happy glow
    Night or day
    It doesn't matter where I go anymore I just go 1)
    If I ever saw you comin' I don't know what I might do
    I'd like to think I could control myself
    But it isn't true
    That's how it is
    When things disintegrate
    And I don't know how much longer I can wait

                  A
    I'm doomed to love you
                                  Em
    I been rollin' through stormy weather
                 A
    I'm thinkin' of you
                                     Bsus4
    And all the places we could roam together

                Em
    It's mighty funny
    The end of time has just begun
    Oh honey, after all these years you're still the one
    Well I'm strollin' through the lonely graveyard of my mind
    I left my life with you
    Somewhere back there along the line
    I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate
    I don't know how much longer I can wait

1) *From Josh Meisler:*

The lyric “*night or day, it doesn't matter anymore where I go, I just
go*” is conspicuously similar to a lyric in the Grateful Dead tune
'Crazy Fingers' which goes “*gone are the days we stopped to decide
where we should go, we just ride*”, by Robert Hunter. Somewhat similar
in construction and definitely in content.

The main changes are in the pace and the mood of the playing, not really
much in the arrangement.  
B7add11=x21200. Or play B7-10 (x21230)

Some remarkable lyrics here, remarkable not just because some of them
show up in *Sugar Baby*

    If we do it in … how about B flat?

            Bbm
    I can't wait
    Eb                           Bbm      Eb
     Wait for you to change your mind
            Bbm
    I can't wait
    Eb                         Bbm
     Waitin' just making me go blind
            Bbm
    Did you ever lay awake at night, your face turned to the wall,
    Eb
    Drowning in your thoughtlessness, and cut off from it all?
            Bbm
    I don't know,
                                Eb
    Maybe for you it's not that late
               Bbm
    But as for me,
                        F7           Bbm
    don't know how much longer I can wait

    It's got to end
    Everything about it just feels wrong
    I pretend
    Being close to her is where I don't belong
    Well, my back is to the sun because the light is too intense
    I can see what everybody in the world is up against
    I'll stay here
    Where I can feel the hand of fate
    And I don't know
    how much longer I can wait.

    Skies are grey
    Life is short, and I think of her a lot
    Every day
    I can't say if I want the pain to end or not
    Well, the blindness overtaking me is beating like a drum
    I don't know where it starts or where it's coming from
    That's how it is
    When I try to concentrate
    And I don't know
    how much longer I can wait.

    I've been drinkin'
    Drinkin' forbidden juices
    I've been livin'
    Livin' on lame excuses.

    My hands are cold
    The end of time has just begun
    I'm gettin' old
    Anything can happen now to anyone
    I walk across the floor till I wear out my shoes
    Think you've lost it all, there's always more to lose
    [I so clear]
    She can keep my head on straight
    And I don't know
    how much longer I can wait.

            Ebm
    I can't wait
    Ab                             Ebm
     Wait for you to change your mind
            Ebm
    I can't wait
    Ab                   Ebm
     For you to walk the line
    Ebm
    You ever feel like just your brain's been bolted to the wall,
                Ab
    That you're drowning in your thoughtlessness and cut off from it all?
            Ebm
    I don't know,
                                Ab
    Maybe for you it's not that late
               Cb7
    But as for me,
                          Bb7          Ebm
    I don't know how much longer I can wait

    It's got to end
    Everything about it just feels wrong
    I'll pretend
    Being close to her is where I don't belong
    Well, my back is to the sun because the light is too intense
    I can see what everybody in the world is up against
    That's how it is
    when things disintegrate
    And I don't know
    how much longer I can wait.

    Skies are grey
    Life is short, and I think of her a lot
    Every day
    I can't say whether I want the pain to even end – or not
    Well, I'm trying my best to stand on my own two feet
    Not have to lean on everybody that I meet
    I'm breathing hard,
    I'm trying to concentrate
    And I don't know
    how much longer I can wait.

    Well, I'm torn and I'm tattered
    I've been rolling through the stormy weather
    My heart's been shattered
    But I'm holding all the parts of it together

    My hands are cold
    The end of time has just begun
    I'm gettin' old
    Anything can happen now to anyone
    Lonelyness around me diggin at me like a ray
    What a piece of work she is to cause my heart to pray
    I thought somehow
    that I'd be spared this fate
    And I don't know
    how much longer I can wait.
