    Well, I'm a-walkin' down the road

    Needs a worried man.

    [1 verse harmonica solo]

    Honey, just allow me one more chance
    To ride your aeroplane.
    Honey, just allow me one more chance
    To ride your passenger train.
    Well, I've been lookin' all over
    For a gal like you,
    I can't find nobody
    So you'll have to do.
    Just-a one kind favor I ask you,
    'Low me just-a one more chance.

    [1 verse harmonica solo]

    Honey, just allow me one more chance
    To get along with you.
    Honey, just allow me one more chance,
    Ah'll do anything with you.
    Well, lookin' for a woman
    That ain't got no man,
    Is just lookin' for a needle
    That is lost in the sand.
    Just-a one kind favor I ask you,
    'Low me just-a one more chance.

    [1 verse harmonica solo]

    It's just-a one kind favor I ask you,
    'Low me just-a one more chance.
