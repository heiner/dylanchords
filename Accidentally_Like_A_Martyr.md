Written by Warren Zevon  
Performed by Bob Dylan during the fall tour 2002  
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

* * * * *

Dylan is mostly faithful to Zevon's version, with the exception of the
first chord in the third line of the verses, which is rather played
something like this:

          Bb          C       Dm  C  Bb  F/a
    Never thought I'd have to pay so dearly

It sounds as if the most pronounced guitar in Dylan's version plays with
D-chords and a capo on the third fret. I've included such a version
below, as well as a version capoed on the 5th fret.

The long chord sequence in the middle of the song is virtually
impossible to play satisfactorily on one guitar: The chords themselves
are simple enough, but you simply can't get both the bass line and the
“dut-dut-dut” figure right at the same time. I've tabbed out a
suggestion in the version with the 5th fret capo. Perhaps surprisingly,
the uncapoed and the 3rd fret capo version sound best, overall, in this
respect.

    The days slide by
    Should have done, should have done, we all sigh
    Never thought I'd ever be so lonely
    After such a long, long time
    Time out of mind

    We made mad love
    Shadow love
    Random love
    And abandoned love
    Accidentally like a martyr
    The hurt gets worse and the heart gets harder
