Just to have mentioned it: the chords are simple enough, although a
guitar player might prefer something like a capo on the third fret and
the chords G, C/g, and D7 instead.

             Eb/bb      Bb
    Well I'm sitting in church
          Eb/bb      Bb
    In an old wooden chair
      Eb/bb  Bb
    I knew nobody
          Eb/bb       Bb
    Would look for me there
               Eb7
    Sorrow and pity

    Rule the earth and the skies
                Bb7
    Looking for nothing
    Eb/bb    Bb
    Anyone's eyes

                      F
    Once I had pretty girls
           Eb
    Did me wrong
                            Bb
    Now I'm marching to the city

    And the road ain't long

    Snowflakes are falling
    Around my head
    Lord have mercy
    It feel heavy like lead
    I been hit too hard
    Seen too much
    Nothing can heal me now
    But your touch

    Once I had a pretty girl
    She done me wrong
    Now I'm marching to the city
    And the road ain't long

    Loneliness
    Got a mind of its own
    The more people around
    The more you feel alone
    I'm chained to the earth
    Like a silent slave
    Trying to break free
    Out of death's dark cave

    Once I had a pretty girl
    Done me wrong
    Now I'm marching to the city
    And the road ain't long

    Boys in the street
    Beginning to play
    Girls like birds
    Flying away
    I'm carrying the roses
    That were given to me
    And I'm thinking about paradise
    Wondering what it might be

    Once I had a pretty girl
    She done me wrong
    Now I'm marching to the city
    And the road ain't long

    Go over to London
    Maybe gay Paree
    Follow the river
    You get to the sea
    I was hoping we could drink from
    Life's clear streams
    I was hoping we could dream
    Life's pleasant dreams

    Once I had a pretty girl
    But she done me wrong
    Now I'm marching to the city
    And the road ain't long

    Well the weak get weaker
    And the strong stay strong
    The train keeps rolling
    All night long
    She looked at me
    With an irresistable glance
    With a smile
    That could make all the planets dance

    Once I had a pretty girl
    She did me wrong
    Now I'm marching to the city
    And the road ain't long

    My house is on fire
    Burning to the skies
    I thought the rain clouds
    But the clouds passed by
    When I'm gone
    You'll remember my name
    I'm gonna win my way
    To wealth and fame

    Once I had a pretty girl
    But she did me wrong
    Now I'm marching to the city
    And the road ain't long

Outtake version (Tell Tale Signs, vol. 3)

</h2>
    E
    Loneliness

    Got a mind of its own

    The more people around

    The more you feel alone
              A7
    I've been chained to the earth

    Like a silent slave
       E
    Im trying to break free

    Out of death's dark cave

    B7
    Once I had a pretty girl

    She did me wrong
            C#m
    Now I'm marching to the city, boys
            A          E
    And the road ain't long

    I was hoping to my soul
    that we'd never part
    You took all the madness
    right out of my heart
    I was hoping we could drink from
    Life's clear streams
    I was hoping we could dream from
    life's pleasant dreams

    My house is burnin'
    up to the skies
    I thought it would rain
    But the clouds passed by
    Sorrow and pity
    Through the earth and the skyes
    I'm not looking for nothing
    In anyone's eyes

    Wind is blowin'
    All troubles and dirt
    Time to get away
    'fore someone gets hurt
    I just don't know
    what I'm a-gonna do
    I was all right
    Till I fell in love with you.
