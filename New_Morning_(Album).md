Introductory Remarks

</h2>
<h3>
Eyolf Østrem

</h3>
*New Morning* has been haunting me ever since I bought it. This
must be Dylan's most stylistically varied album ever (possibly topped by
[”Love and Theft”](”Love and Theft”)), but I still can't
decide whether it belongs in the “weak” category together with [Self
Portrait](Self Portrait), or if it is a glorious testimony to
the *sprezzatura* that only Dylan can handle without collapsing
completely.

I've had heated discussions with a friend of mine about “[The Man in
Me](The Man in Me)” – is it a good song? an exuberant
jubilation of the bliss of true love? a rare moment in Dylan's catalogue
of a love song with no hint whatsoever of uncertainty, bitterness, pain?
No! it's just *too* sweet; things that are too good to be true
usually aren't. It's like “[Sara](Sara)” or “[Wedding
Song](Wedding Song)”, another couple of songs that I just
can't take seriously. What *they* have, though, is an intrinsic
seriousness which commands some kind of respect: *only* Dylan can
say “I love you more than blood” and get away with it.

And what does “The Man in Me” have ?

“La la la la la.” Not quite the same.

In the same category come “[If Not for You](If Not for You)”
(“I'd be sad and blue” or “I wouldn't have a clue / If not for you” –
c'mon Bob, you can rhyme better than that!), and, to some extent, “[New
Morning](New Morning)” and
“[Winterlude](Winterlude)”. But they aren't too bad after
all: Winterlude has this corny,
guy-on-the-sleeve-of-Nashville-Skyline-ish, country dude thing going on,
and if such a down-to-earth guy “thinks you're fine”, what is there to
complain about? And “New Morning” has these wonderful snapshots of
situations which may be just reminiscenses of random glimpses, but which
*may* also be filled with meaning (“Rabbit runnin' down across
the road / Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through”,
“Automobile comin' into style / Comin' down the road for a country mile
or two”), and they are introduced with a shade of desperation in the
insistent questions: “Can't you hear…?” (“You *really* can't hear
it? Don't you *remember*? But… that was an *important
*moment! I thought we shared it… Don't you love me anymore?”)
Besides, the song is forever redeemed by the treatment it got in 1991 –
when someone goes though something like *that*, you just have to
care for them . . .

The three songs that *really* got to me and made me think of it
as a great album after all, were “[If Dogs Run
Free](If Dogs Run Free)”, “[Three
Angels](Three Angels)” and “[Father of
Night](Father of Night)”. I'm not *positive* that the
scat singing in “Dogs…” is great, but I know it makes me smile. And the
choir on the other two… heavenly! In fact, if Dylan ever wrote a
heavenly line of music, it's the two bars of dirty-winged angels' song
between the verses in “Father of Night”, or the very end of “Three
Angels”.
