    Well, a  marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred

    The man put us together, now, you wanna make it
            D
    Stick together
                              A
    Come on, come on, stick together.
                  E                                    A
    You know, we made a vow, not to leave one another, never

    Well, ya never miss you water till your well runs dry
    Come one, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together
    Come on, come on, stick together
    We made a vow, not to leave one another, never.

    Well, ya never miss your water till your well runs dry
    Come one, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together
    Come on, come on, stick together
    You know, we made a vow, not to leave one another, never.

    It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
    Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy
    Let's stick together
    Come on, come on, stick together
    You know, we made a vow, not to leave one another, never.
