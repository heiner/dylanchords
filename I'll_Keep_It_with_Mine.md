Words and music Bob Dylan  
Recorded Jan 14, 1965 and Jan 27, 1966, released on
[Biograph](/wiki/Biograph "wikilink") (1985) and [The Bootleg Series
1-3](/wiki/The Bootleg Series 1-3 "wikilink") respectively  
Tabbed by Eyolf Ã˜strem

Since these are both played at the piano, the value as a guitar tab is
limited, but what the heck...

             C/e     F    C/g  F/a  C/g
    You will search, babe,
     F C/e G/d F/a
    At a - ny  cost.
            C/e         F  C/g  F/a
    But how long, babe,
    C/g     F      C/e G/d    C   F/a
    Can you search for what's not lost?
    C/e F C/g  F/a  C/g    F  C/e
    Ev'ry-body will help you,
         F          C/g  F/c
    Some people are very kind.
           C F C/e  Dm     C    F/a C/g G/d C    F/a
    But if I           can save you a - ny  time,
    C     /b F/a     C/g F
    Come on, give it to  me,
    C/e  Dm      F11  C
    I'll keep it with mine.

    I can't help it
    If you might think I'm odd,
    If I say I'm loving you
    not for what you are But for what you're not.
    Everybody will help you
    Discover what you set out to find.
    But if I
    can save you any time,
    Come on, give it to me,
    I'll keep it with mine.

    Everybody will help you
    Discover what you set out to find.
    But if I
    can save you any time,
    Come on, give it to me,
    I'll keep it with mine.

    Now the train leaves
    At half past ten,
    But it'll be back,
    in the same old spot again.
    The conductor
    He's still stuck on the line.
    And if I
    can save you any time,
    Come on, give it to me,
    I'll keep it with mine.
