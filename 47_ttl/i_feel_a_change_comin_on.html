  <h1 class="songtitle">I Feel a Change Coming On</h1>


<p>Music by Bob Dylan, lyrics by Bob Dylan and Robert Hunter<br />
Released on <a href="index.html" class="recordlink">Together Through Life</a> (2009)<br />
Tabbed by Eyolf &Oslash;strem</p>

<hr />
<p>
Written out with a capo  on the 1st fret (sounding key: Bb). Another
alternative is to use a 3rd fret capo and the chords G, Em, Am, D11, which
is easier to play, but misses the deep, full E sound for the last chord in
each &lsquo;round&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>
Lots of things going on here, even though it sounds simple enough.
Especially the chord noted as an E11 is only vaguely defined. Alternatives
to E11 are plain E, E7, or some other muddy version of E.
</p>
<p>
The &lsquo;last part of the day&hellip;&rsquo; part could be (and is, at
least at one point) embellished as: 
</p>
