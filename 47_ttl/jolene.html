<p>
If you absolutely want to play this on a single guitar, and at least
<i> try</i> to include the lick in the refrain, the easiest thing to do is
to play it with a capo on the 6th fret, hence the chords below. Otherwise,
pick any key and play a <a href="../roadmaps.htm#shuffle">regular shuffle</a> with the straight three-chord chords.
</p>

<pre class="tab">
The lick (play at *):
  :     .     .     .       :     .     .     .      
|-------------3---2-------|-------------------------|
|-------------------5---3-|-5-----------------------|
|-------------------------|-------2---2-------------|
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
|-------------------------|-------------------------|

Without the capo:
  :     .     .     .       :     .     .     .

<pre class="verse">
            A                       
Well you're comin' down High Street, 

walkin' in the sun

You make the dead man rise, 

and holler she's the one
  D     *
Jolene, 
  A     *
Jolene
      E            D               A        * 
Baby, I am the king and you're the queen
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
Well it's a long old highway, don't ever end
I've got a Saturday night special, I'm back again
I'll sleep by your door, lay my life on the line
You probably don't know, but I'm gonna make you mine
Jolene, Jolene
Baby, I am the king and you're the queen
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
I keep my hands in my pocket, I'm movin' along
People think they know, but they're all wrong
You're something nice, I'm gonna grab my dice
I can't say I haven't paid the price
Jolene, Jolene
Baby I am the king and you're the queen
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
Well I found out the hard way, I've had my fill
You can't find somebody with his back to a hill
Those big brown eyes, they set off a spark
When you hold me in your arms things don't look so dark
Jolene, Jolene
Baby I am the king and you're the queen
