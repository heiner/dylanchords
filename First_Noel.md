    G     Em D C   G      C   G
The first Noel the angels did sing
C      G       C    G   C     D  G      D       G
Was to certain poor shepherds In fields as they lay
   G      Em    D    C     G       C     G
In fields where they lay a-keeping their sheep
C    G       C     G  C  D    G D    G
On a cold winter's night that was so deep
      G   Em D  G/b C D G
    Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
    Em   D  C   G C  D  G D G
    Born is the king of Israel

<em>[They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east beyond them far
And to the Earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night]</em>
    Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
    Born is the king of Israel
    Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
    Born is the king of Israel

And by the light of that same star
three wise men came from country far
to seek for a king was their intent
and to follow the star wherever it went.
      G   Em D  G/b C /d /e /f# G    D/f#
    Noel, Noel, Noel,     No -  el
    Em   D  C   G C  D  G D G
    Born is the king of Israel

    C   D  G
    O   No-el
