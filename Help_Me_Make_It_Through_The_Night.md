                               C
    Take the ribbons from your hair
                             F
    Shake it lose and let it fall
                             G
    Lay it soft against your skin
                            C
    Like the shadows on the wall

    Come and lay down by my side
    Till the early morning bright
    All I'm taking is your time
    Help me make it through the night

                                  F
    I don't care what's right or wrong
                        C
    I don't try to understand
                         D
    Let the devil take tomorrow
                         G    (/f /e /d  or   F Em Dm)
    For tonight I need a friend

    Yesterday is dead and gone
    And tomorrow's out of sight
    I don't care what's right or wrong
    Help me make it through the night

    [instrumental verses]

    I don't care what's right or wrong
    I don't try to understand
    Let the devil take tomorrow
    For tonight I need a friend

    I don't care what's right or wrong
    I don't try to understand
    And today is also dead and gone
    Help me make it through the night.
