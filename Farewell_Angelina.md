    Farewell Angeli  - na
        Fmaj7        C
    The bells of the crown
              C         Fmaj7 C
    Are being stolen by ban - dits
           Fmaj7      C
    I must follow the sound
        C
    The triangle tingles
        Fmaj7      C
    the music play slow
            C        Am
    But farewell Angelina
        C           Em/b
    The night is on fire
    F          C      Csus4 C
    And I must go.

             C
    There is no use in talkin'
                Fmaj7       C     Fmaj7 C
    and there's no need for blame

    There is nothing to prove,
         Fmaj7              C     Fmaj7 C
    Ev'rything still is the same
      C
    A table stands empty
           Fmaj7       C       Csus4 C
    By the edge of the stream
            C        Em/b
    But farewell Angelina
        C              Am
    The sky's changing colours
    Fmaj7      C         Csus4 C
    And I must leave.

        C
    The jacks and the queens
            Fmaj7         C       Fmaj7 C
    they forsake the courtyard
    C
    Fifty-two gypsies
        Fmaj7         C          Fmaj7 C
    Now file past the guards
           C
    In the space where the deuce
            Fmaj7        C       Fmaj7 C
    And the ace once ran wild
        C        Em/b
    Farewell Angelina
        C      Am
    The sky is folding
                 Fmaj7   C      Csus4 C
    I'll see you after a while.

            C
    See the cross-eyed pirates sit
    Fmaj7          C        Csus4 C
    Perched in the sun
    C            Fmaj7
    Shooting tin cans
                         C  Fmaj7 C
    With a sawed-off shotgun
            C
    And the corporals and neighbors
             Fmaj7           C     Csus4 C
    clap and cheer with each blast
            C        Em/b
    But farewell Angelina
        C         Am
    The sky it is trembling
        Fmaj7        C
    And I must leave fast.

         C
    King Kong, little elves
           Fmaj7          C      Csus4 C
    In the rooftoops they dance
         C
    Valentino-type tangos
              Fmaj7        C     Csus4 C
    While the hero's clean hands

    Shut the eyes of the dead
             Fmaj7      C        Csus4 C
    Not to embarrass anyone
        C        Am
    Farewell Angelina
        C               Am
    The sky is flooding over
    Fmaj7         C            Csus4 C
    And I must be gone.

        C
    The camouflaged parrot
       Fmaj7         C        Csus4 C
    He flutters from fear
         C                    Am
    when something he doesn't know about
    Fmaj7      C              Csus4 C
    suddenly appears
         C
    What cannot be imitated
    Fmaj7        C            Csus4 C
    perfect must die
        C        Am
    Farewell Angelina
        C              Am
    The sky's flooding over
          Fmaj7               C     Csus4 C
    and I must go where it is dry

       C             Am
    Machine guns are roaring
    Fmaj7         C       Csus4 C
    Puppets heave rocks
        C
    At misunderstood visions
               F        C       F C
    and at the faces of clocks
            C            Am
    Call me any name you like
           F(maj7) C        F C
    I will never deny it
            C        Am
    But farewell Angelina
        C       Am
    The sky is erupting
          F(maj7)            C
    And I must go where it's quiet.

    Am  F  C
