Unplugged version

(the *Greatest hits* version is basically the same, but with a capo on

    C
    Fat man lookin in a blade of steel

    Thin man lookin at his last meal
    F                      C
    Hollow man lookin in a cottonfield
                 F/g  C
    For dignity


    Wise man lookin in a blade of grass
    Young man lookin in the shadows that pass
    Poor man lookin through painted glass
    For dignity

    G
    Somebody got murdered on New Years Eve
    F                             C
    Somebody said dignity was the first to leave
           F                   C/e
    I went into the city, went into the town
                  Dm                   F/g
    Went into the land of the midnight sun

    Searchin high, searchin low
    Searchin everywhere I know
    Askin the cops wherever I go
    Have you seen dignity?

    Blind man breakin out of a trance
    Puts both his hands in the pockets of chance
    Hopin' to find one circumstance
    Of dignity

    I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou
    She said I dont want nobody see me talkin to you
    Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew
    About dignity

    I went down where the vultures feed
    I would've gone deeper, but there wasnt any need
    Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
    Wasnt any difference to me

    Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade
    House on fire, debts unpaid
    Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid
    Have you seen dignity?

    Drinkin' man listens to the voice he hears
    In a crowded room full of covered up mirrors
    Lookin into the lost forgotten years
    For dignity

    Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues
    Said hed give me information if his name wasn't used
    He wanted money up front, said he was abused
    By dignity

    Footprints runnin cross the silver sand
    Steps goin down into tattoo land
    I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
    In the bordertowns of despair

    Got no place to fade, got no coat
    I'm on the rollin river in a jerkin boat
    Tryin' to read a note somebody wrote
    About dignity

    Sick man lookin' for the doctors cure
    Lookin' at his hands for the lines that were
    And into every masterpiece of literature
    For dignity

    Englishman stranded in the blackheart wind
    Combin' his hair back, his future looks thin
    Bites the bullet and he looks within
    For dignity

    Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed
    Dignity never been photographed
    I went into the red, went into the black
    Into the valley of dry bone dreams

    So many roads, so much at stake
    So many dead ends, I'm at the edge of the lake
    Sometimes I wonder what its gonna take
    To find dignity

    to the land of the midnight sun

    Searchin high, searchin low
    Searchin everywhere I know
    Askin the cops wherever I go
    Have you seen dignity?

    Blind man breakin out of a trance
    Puts both his hands in the pockets of chance
    Hopin' to find one circumstance
    Of dignity

    Stranger stares down into the light
    From a platinum window in the Mexican night
    Searching every bloodsucking thing inside
    for dignity

    I went down where the vultures feed
    I would've gone deeper, but there wasnt any need
    Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
    It all sounded no different to me

    Soul of a nation is under the knife
    Death is standing in the doorway of life,
    In the next room a man fighting with his wife
    over Dignity.

Lyrics transcribed by [Craig
Thomas](http://www.allalongthewatchtower.dk/phorum/read.php?1,375888)

    Fat man lookin at a ferris wheel
    Yellow man lookin' at his last meal
    Hollow man lookin' in a cottonfield
    For dignity

    Wise man lookin in a blade of grass
    Young man lookin in the days that pass
    Poor man lookin through painted glass
    For dignity

    Dignity is a woman that knows
    Dignity moves like a tropical wind that blows
    into the cities, into the towns
    into the land of the midnight sun

    I'm searchin high, I'm searchin low
    Searchin everywhere I know
    Askin the cops wherever I go
    Have you seen dignity?

    Drunk man listens to a voice he hears
    in a crowded room, full of covered-up mirrors
    looking to the lost forgotten years
    for dignity

    Don Juan was talking to Don Miguel
    Standin' outside the gates of Hell
    There ain't nothing to say, there ain't nothing to tell
    'bout dignity

    Dignity is a woman unspoiled
    By fame and greed and snakes that are coiled
    In the damp woods, on the river's edge
    Near the green, green grass of home

    Pull into the platform, step off the train
    Walk thirty steps, it begins to rain
    I'm asking somebody with water on his brain
    Have you seen dignity?

    Cities in a mess of jackhammer beats
    Buses roll by with burned-out seats
    A child's eyes look through the creeping streets
    For dignity

    Prince Phillip was talking to Miss Mary Lou
    She said don't let nobody see me talking to you
    She's afraid to tell him what she knew
    About dignity

    Dignity is a woman that's light
    She don't tease, she don't travel at night
    Dignity is a woman that bleeds
    Like the hot Egyptian sun

    I'm looking east, looking west
    See people cursed, see people blessed
    Asking everybody like a man possessed
    Have you seen dignity?

    Blind man breaking out of a trance
    Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
    Hoping to find one circumstance
    Of dignity

    Englishman stranded in the blackheart wind
    Combing his hair back, his future looks thin
    Bites the bullet and he looks within
    For dignity

    Somebody showed me a picture and I just laughed
    Dignity never been photographed
    Dignity got no starting-point
    No beginning, no middle, no end

    Looking at a glass that's half-filled
    Looking at a dream that's just been killed
    Asking everybody that's strong-willed
    Have you seen dignity?
