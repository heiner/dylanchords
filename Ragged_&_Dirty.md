Written by Yank Rachell and Sleepy John Estes  
arranged by Bob Dylan and played on [World Gone
Wrong](World Gone Wrong) (1993)  
Tabbed by Eyolf Ã˜strem

Capo 4th fret (original key E major)

The trick is to get the riff that runs through the whole song right.
This riff appears everywhere where there's a G, and it's always played
twice in a row. The adjacent open strings *should* be sounding,
especially at the end of the riff, where you get the delicious clash
between the Bb of the third string and the B of the open second string.
The : and | indicate the beats. Most of the melody notes come a little
before the beat, and should be played on the upstrokes. Throughout all
of this, you keep strumming, but lightly, mainly to indicate the basic
rhythm.  
For the initial slide up ( / = slide up), you already have the index
finger in place from the C chord. Use that.

    Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds
    Went to my window, babe I couldn't see through my blinds
    Heard my best friend coming around I thought I heard my baby cry.

    Lord, if I can't come in here, baby then just let me sit down in your door
    If I can't come in here baby then just let me sit down in your door
    And I would leave so soon that your man won't never know.

    How can I live here baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
    How can I live here baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
    Well, that woman I got, man, she do just what she feels.

    Lord you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild
    Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild
    You must always remember, baby, you was once a child.

    'Cause I'm leaving in the morning, if I have to ride the blind
    Leaving in the morning, if I have to ride the blinds
    Well, I've been mistreated and I swear, I don't mind dyin'.
