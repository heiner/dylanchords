    No, and I ain't lookin' to fight with you
    Frighten you or uptighten you
    Drag you down or drain you down
    Chain you down or bring you down
    All I really want to do
    Is, baby, be friends with you.

    I ain't lookin' to block you up
    Shock or knock or lock you up
    Analyze you, categorize you
    Finalize you or advertise you
    All I really want to do
    Is, baby, be friends with you.

    I don't want to straight-face you
    Race or chase you, track or trace you
    Or disgrace you or displace you
    Or define you or confine you
    All I really want to do
    Is, baby, be friends with you.

    I don't want to meet your kin
    Make you spin or do you in
    Or select you or dissect you
    Or inspect you or reject you
    All I really want to do
    Is, baby, be friends with you.

    I don't want to fake you out
    Take or shake or forsake you out
    I ain't lookin' for you to feel like me
    See like me or be like me
    All I really want to do
    Is, baby, be friends with you.
