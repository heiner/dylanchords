    Down in Carlisle, there lived a lady
               C/g *)        G               C/g G      *) Not played in the
    Being most beautiful and gay                           first verse
              G
    She was determined to live a lady
              C           D     G            C/g G
    No man on earth could she betray

    Unless it were a man of honor
    A man of honor, and high degree
    And down the road came two loved soldiers
    This fair lady for to see

    The first one being a brave lieutenant
    A brave lieutenant and a man of war
    The other being a brave sea captain
    Captain on the ship that came from far

    Then up spoke this fair young lady
    Said: "I can't be but one man's bride
    If you'll come back tomorrow morning
    On this case we will decide"

    She ordered her a span of horses
    Span of horses at her command
    And down the road these three did travel
    'til they came to the lions' den

    There they stopped and there they halted
    These three young soldiers lay gazing round
    And for the space of half an hour
    This young lady lay speechless on the ground

    When at last she did recover
    She threw her light fan in the lions' den
    Saying "Which of you to gain a lady
    Will retrieve that fan again?"

    Then up spoke the brave lieutentant
    In a voice both loud and clear
    Sayin': "Oh, I am a dear lover of women
    But I will never give my life for them"

    Then up spoke this brave sea captain
    In a voice both clear and high
    Sayin': "Oh, I am a true lover of women
    I will return her fan or die"

    Down in the lions' den he boldy entered
    The lions being both loud and fierce
    He marched around in and among them
    safely returned her fan again

    And when she saw her true lover coming
    Seeing no harm had been done to him
    She threw herself unto his bosom
    Saying "Here's the prize that you have won"
