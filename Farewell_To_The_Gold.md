    D        Em7   C                D
    Shotover River, your gold it is waning
             C(add9)         D          G       D
    And it's years since the color I've seen.
    D           Em7      C         D
    No use just sitting, Lady Luck blaming
         C(add9)     D            G       C/g  G
    I'll pack up and make a break clean.

    D               Dsus4 D      G       D
    Farewell to the gold    that never I found,
        D          Dsus4 D      G          D
    Goodbye to the nuggets that somewhere abound;
             G         C             G         D
    For it's only when dreaming that I see you gleaming
         C           D         G
    Down in the dark deep underground.

    It's nearly three years since I left my old mother
    For adventure and gold by the pound.
    With Jimmy the prospector, he was another,
    For the hills of Otago we were bound.

    Farewell . . .

    We worked the Cardrona's dry valley all over
    Old Jimmy Williams and me.
    They were panning good dust on the winding shotover
    So we headed down there just to see.

    Farewell . . .

    We sluiced and we cradled for day after day
    Barely making enough to get by;
    Then a terrible flood swept poor Jimmy away
    During six stormy days in July.

    Farewell . . .
