Written by Bob Dylan, during his stay in London in December 1962.  
The song has been taped once by Dylan (July 17 1963 in the home of David
Whitaker, Minneapolis, Minn.), but the tape is not in circulation
(thanks to Miguel Angel for notifying me). The following tab is
therefore based upon the version by *Lennon & Hyam*, formerly found at
the Shelter From The Storm website.  
 Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

I've prepared a sheet-music version:
[<http://www.dylanchords.com/00_misc/liverpool_gal.pdf>](http://www.dylanchords.com/00_misc/liverpool_gal.pdf)

Lennon & Hyam use a kind of arrangement that Dylan would never have
played in 1962. The following is a reversal, back to simple chords. I've
indicated the rhythm in the first verse. They use a capo on the 6th fret
(sounding key F\# major)

The melody is clearly based upon [The Lakes of
Pontchartrain](/wiki/The Lakes of Pontchartrain "wikilink") or a related tune
(apparently Dylan learned “Lakes...” from Paul Brady in 1984).

         C   . . /b . .  Am . . F   . .
    When first I came to London town
      C/g . .  G . . F . G C . .
    A stranger I did come
        C        /b         Am    F
    I'd walk the streets so silently
      C/g     G       F   G C
    I did not know no-one
          Am . .   Em     .  .  F . G    C   . .
    I was thinking thoughts and dreaming dreams
        C  . .        Em .  F  . . G .
    The kind when you roll along
    .   C       /b        Am        F
    But most of all I was thinking about
        C/g      G         Am . . Em . . F . . G .
    the land I'd left back home

    I'd stand by the river Themes
    with the wind blowing through my hair.
    And who should come and stand by me
    but a London gal so fair.
    Her eyes were blue, her hair was brown
    Her face was gentle and kind
    For a second, well, I clear forgot
    The land I left behind

    As we began walking and talkin'
    All through the English air
    I did not know where we'd end up
    'til we came to the top of a stair
    As we lay round on a worn-out rug
    the room it was so cold
    And we talked for hours by the inside fire
    'bout the outside world so old.

    All through our sweet conversation
    She thought my ways were so strange
    But I know there was one thing about me
    That she would try to change
    And the night passed on with the drizzeling rain
    There's one thing I found out
    [A pair of sweet curls] I know too well,
    Her love I know not much about *)

    And I awoke the next morning
    And the rain had turned to snow
    I looked out of her window
    And I knew that I must go
    I did not know how to tell her
    I didn't know if I could
    But she smiled a smile I'd never seen
    To say she understood.

    And thinking of her as I stood in the snow
    How strange she appeared to be,
    On the reason I was leaving,
    she seemed no better than me.
    I gazed all up at her window
    where the snowy snow-flakes blowed
    I put my hands in my pockets
    And I walked 'long down the road.

    So it's now I'm leaving London, boys
    Well, the town I'll soon forget,
    Likewise its winds and weather
    Likewise some people I met
    But there's one thing that's for certain
    Sure as the sunshine down
    I'll never forget that Liverpool Gal
    Who lived in London Town.

\*) Lennon & Hyam sing “Of her. . .”, and have to make a strange
maneuvre at the end to make it fit, but the “Of. . .” isn't necessary,
lyrically, and the line is easier to sing without it.
