Did you ever expect to hear a line like “The buying power of the
proletariat's gone down” in a song lyric? Way to go, Bobby! In a
straight line from [Ballad of Hollis
Brown](Ballad of Hollis Brown), through the ''Farm Aid
''initiative in the eighties, here's one of the highlights of the album
— but more than a political statement, it is also a love-ballad.

Musically, it is a close cousin of [Cross the Green
Mountain](Cross the Green Mountain) with which it shares the
ever-descending bass line and some of the chord shadings that never
manage to decide whether they're major or minor (and *which* minor they
are!).

A stroke of genius is the G7 between the verses — the only place where
this is actually a blues song.

“I say it, so it must be so.”

Capo 2nd fret (sounding key A major)

Chords:

The G/d in the second line (marked with \*) below) can be played in many
different ways, in addition to the plain xx0003. A well-sounding
solution, which captures the f\# (sounding: g\#) in the strings, is to
play it as 354000 or 054000, and to play the preceeding Em as 075000.
This gives a nice descent on the guitar neck down to the C in the next
measure (-75--- -54--- -32---).

    D/f#        200232 or xx4030
    Em          022000 or 075000
    Gmaj7       354000
    Em9         054000
    D9          xx0210
    G7          320031

               G            D/f#
    There's an evening haze settling over town,
    Em                          G/d *)
    Starlight by the edge of the creek
        C                        G/b
    The buying power of the proletariat's gone down,
    Am                          D
    Money's getting shallow and weak

    Well, the place I love best is a sweet memory
    it's a new path that we trod
    They say low wages are a reality
    If we want to compete abroad    

    My cruel weapons have been put on the shelf
    Come sit down on my knee
    You are dearer to me than myself
    As you yourself can see
    While I'm listening to the steel rails hum
    Got both eyes tight shut
    Just sitting here trying to keep the hunger from
    Creeping it's way into my gut 

    C                            G6/b
    Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
    Am                    G
    Bring me my boots and shoes
            C                            G/b
    You can hang back or fight your best on the front line
    Am                         D9           G7

    Well, I'm sailin' on back, ready for the long haul
    Tossed by the winds and the seas
    I'll drag 'em all down to hell and I'll stand 'em at the wall
    I'll sell 'em to their enemies
    I'm a-tryin' to feed my soul with thought
    Gonna sleep off the rest of the day
    Sometimes no one wants what you got
    Sometimes you can't give it away 

    Now the place is ringed with countless foes
    Some of them may be deaf and dumb
    No man, no woman knows
    The hour that sorrow will come
    In the dark I hear the night birds call
    I can feel a lover's breath
    I sleep in the kitchen with my feet in the hall
    Sleep is like a temporary death 

    Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
    Bring me my boots and shoes
    You can hang back or fight your best on the front line

    Well, they burned my barn, and they stole my horse
    I can't save a dime
    I got to be careful, I don't want to be forced
    Into a life of continual crime
    I can see for myself that the sun is sinking
    How I wish you were here to see
    Tell me now, am I wrong in thinking
    That you have forgotten me?

    Now they worry and they hurry and they fuss and they fret
    They waste your nights and days
    Them I will forget
    But you I'll remember always
    Old memories of you to me have clung
    You've wounded me with your words
    Gonna have to straighten out your tongue
    It's all true, everything you've heard

    Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
    Bring me my boots and shoes
    You can hang back or fight your best on the front line
    Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues

    In you, my friend, I find no blame
    Wanna look in my eyes, please do
    No one can ever claim
    That I took up arms against you.
    All across the peaceful sacred fields
    They will lay you low
    They'll break your horns and slash you with steel
    I say it, so it must be so

    Now I'm down on my luck and I'm black and blue
    Gonna give you another chance
    I'm all alone I'm expecting you
    To lead me off in a cheerful dance
    I got a brand new suit and a brand new wife
    I can live on rice and beans
    Some people never worked a day in their life
    Don't know what work even means

    Well, meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
    Bring me my boots and shoes
    You could hang back or fight your best on the front line
    Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues
