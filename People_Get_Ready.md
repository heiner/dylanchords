By Curtis Mayfield  
Played by Bob Dylan during [The Basement
Tapes](The Basement Tapes "wikilink") sessions (1967), and released on
the promo EP for *Renaldo and Clara* (1976/78)  
Tabbed by Eyolf Ã˜strem

Renaldo and Clara version

</h2>
Same chord progression repeated throughout. The lyrics aren't always
decipherable, mainly because Dylan doesn't quite remember them. Which
makes this a wonderful proof of his ability to improvise on the spot.

    Bb         Gm               Eb      Bb
    People get ready, there's a train a comin'
    picking up passengers coast to coast
    All you need is faith to hear the diesels a-hummin'
    [...] among the loved the most.

    People get ready for that train to Jordan
    picking up passengers [...]
    All you need is faith to hear those diesels a-hummin'
    Don't need no ticket, you just thank the Lord

    There ain't no roomfor the hopeless sinner
    Who would hurt all mankind just to save his own
    Have pity on those whose chances get slimmer
    For there's no hiding place among the Kingdom's throne

    So people get ready, there's a train a-comin'
    don't need no baggage, you just get on board
    All you need is faith to hear the diesels a-hummin'
    Don't need no ticket, you just thank the Lord

    [D: "remember this one"]

    C          (/e)             F       C
    People get ready, there's a train a comin'
                                        F      C
    You don't need no baggage, you just get on board
                                      F       C
    All you need is faith to hear the diesels hummin'
                  Am               F         C
    Don't need no ticket, you just thank the Lord

    People get ready for the train to Jordan
    picking up passengers from coast to coast
    Faith is the key, open the doors and board 'em
    There's hope for all among those loved the most.

    There ain't no roomfor the hopeless sinner
    Who would hurt all mankind just to save his own
    Have pity on those whose chances grow thinner
    For there's no hiding place against the Kingdom's throne

    So people get ready, there's a train a comin'
    You don't need no baggage, you just get on board
    All you need is faith to hear the diesels hummin'
    Don't need no ticket, you just thank the Lord
