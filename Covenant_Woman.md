Words and Music by Bob Dylan  
Released on [Saved](Saved (Album)) (1980)  
Tabbed by Eyolf Ã˜strem

This is a song for the whole 1980 gospel band. The original key is F
major. For guitar only there seem to be two possibilities:  
Capo 3rd fret, chords of D major, or capo 5th fret, chords of C major.  
I'm sure he plays one of these on the album, but I'm not certain about
which one. I seem to hear a D minor chord type'ish sound in the second
line, which would suggest the C major version, but then again, the D
version gives the pleasant A major at the end, and the least awkward
chords overall.

    C        Am          Em                Dm
    Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
                                     Am        G
    Way up yonder, great will be her reward.
    C        Am     Em                     Dm
    Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
                                             Am    G
    I know I can trust you to stay the way you are.

        F             Am
    And I just got to tell you
         Bb      /c
    I do intend
    F       Am              Bb     /c
    To stay closer than any friend.
    F             Am
    I just got to thank you
           Bb
    Once again
                    C       /Bb
    For making your prayers known
    /a /g  C  /Bb    /a  /g
    Unto heaven for me
        C  /Bb  /a    /g  C    /Bb
    And to you,    always,  so grateful
    /a        /g   F
    I will forever be.

    | C . . G  |

    I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup.
    I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up
    And I know He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
    He must have loved me so much to send me someone as fine as you.

    And I just got to tell you
    I do intend
    To stay closer than any friend.
    I just got to thank you
    Once again
    For making your prayers known
    Unto heaven for me
    And to you, always, so grateful
    I will forever be.

    Covenant woman, intimate little girl
    Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world.
    You know we are strangers in a land we're passing through.
    I'll always be right by your side, I've got a covenant too.

    And I just got to tell you
    I do intend
    To stay closer than any friend.
    I just got to thank you
    Once again
    For making your prayers known
    Unto heaven for me
    And to you, always, so grateful
    I will forever be.
