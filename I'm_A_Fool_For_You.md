            G            Am    Bm       Am            G     Am Bm
    and its too high for me to count, I can't get the number
    Am             G   Am Bm

        Am             G   Am Bm Am

    Well, you hear my celebrate, oh its story
    but they're all too vain for me, all they want is glory
    I'm a fool for you
    I'm a fool for you

             C                             G
    well its lonely in my days how can I believe
            C                                 D
    and its all in my heart but I just can't receive, yeah hear me now

    It's crazy down in love ridin' all around
    it's the rain it come down like a me it's underground
    I'm a fool for you
    yeah I'm a fool for you

    well it's lonely in my dead but I just don't believe
    andt it's to harden in my pride but I cant recieve, oh hear me now

    when I come back when I don't make my return
    yeah the heart shall rise, everybody shall burn
    yes, I'm a fool for you
    I'm a fool for you
