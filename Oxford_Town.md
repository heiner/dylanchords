    D3           G      D
    Oxford Town, Oxford Town
    G                                 D
    Ev'rybody's got their heads bowed down
            G                          D
    The sun don't shine above the ground
            G                    D
    Ain't a-goin' down to Oxford Town

    He went down to Oxford Town
    Guns and clubs followed him down
    All because his face was brown
    Better get away from Oxford Town

    Oxford Town around the bend
    He come in to the door, he couldn't get in
    All because of the color of his skin
    What do you think about that, my frien'?

    Me and my gal, my gal's son
    We got met with a tear gas bomb
    I don't even know why we come
    Goin' back where we come from

    Oxford Town in the afternoon
    Ev'rybody singin' a sorrowful tune
    Two men died 'neath the Mississippi moon
    Somebody better investigate soon

    Oxford Town, Oxford Town
    Ev'rybody's got their heads bowed down
    The sun don't shine above the ground
    Ain't a-goin' down to Oxford Town
