<h2 class="songversion">Alternate lyrics</h2>

From the Martin Luther King Jr. Tribute, Washington, DC January 20, 1986

<p class="verse"> They say every man needs protection<br>
They say that every man must fall<br>
I swear I see my own reflection<br>
Somewhere so high above this wall</p>
<p class="refrain">
I see my light come shinin'<br>
I don't need no doctor or no priest<br>
Any day now, any day now<br>
I shall be released</p>
<p class="verse">It don't take much to be a criminal<br>
One wrong move and they'll turn you into one<br>
At first decay is just subliminal<br>
To protect yourself and your forever on the run</p>
<p class="refrain">
I see my light come shinin'<br>
I don't need no doctor or no priest<br>
Any day now, any day now<br>
I shall be released
</p>
<p class="verse"> He will find you where your stayin'<br>
Even in the arms of somebody elses wife<br>
Your laughin' now, you should be prayin'<br>
To be in the midnight hour of your life </p>
<p class="refrain">I see my light come shinin'<br>
I don't need no doctor or no priest<br>
Any day now, any day now<br>
I shall be released
</p>
