    They say ev'ry man needs protection,
    They say ev'ry man must fall.
    Yet I swear I see my reflection
    Some place so high above this wall.

    I see my light come shining
    From the west unto the east.
    Any day now, any day now,
    I shall be released.

    Now yonder standing here in this lonely crowd,
    a man who swears he's not to blame.
    All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
    Crying out that he was framed.

    I see my light come shining
    From the west unto the east.
    Any day now, any day now,
    I shall be released.

Alternate lyrics

</h2>
From the Martin Luther King Jr. Tribute, Washington, DC January 20, 1986

They say every man needs protection  
They say that every man must fall  
I swear I see my own reflection  
Somewhere so high above this wall

I see my light come shinin'  
I don't need no doctor or no priest  
Any day now, any day now  
I shall be released

It don't take much to be a criminal  
One wrong move and they'll turn you into one  
At first decay is just subliminal  
To protect yourself and your forever on the run

I see my light come shinin'  
I don't need no doctor or no priest  
Any day now, any day now  
I shall be released

He will find you where your stayin'  
Even in the arms of somebody elses wife  
Your laughin' now, you should be prayin'  
To be in the midnight hour of your life

I see my light come shinin'  
I don't need no doctor or no priest  
Any day now, any day now  
I shall be released
