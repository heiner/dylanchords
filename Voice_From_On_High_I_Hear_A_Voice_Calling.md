Dylan's version

</h2>
Dylan is closer to Bill Monroe's version than to the Stanley Brothers',
both in the lyrics and in the turn to A7 (D7 in Monroe's version) in the
verse.  
If anyone can make out what he is (or should be) singing in the first
verse, I'd be happy to receive a note. The only radical difference from
the older versions is the end of the lines in the chorus: *they* hold
them and weave a little something between the voices -- Dylan & Co cut
it short.

    G

                   G           C           G
    I hear a voice calling, it must be our Lord
                               D      D7
    He's calling from heaven on high
                   G             C            G    C/g  G
    I hear a voice calling, I've gained the reward
                          D          G       C/g   G
    In the land where we never shall die

                      G      C               G
    [The Saviour has] paid a great price for me
                               A7                  D       D7
    He died on the hill so [my friends?] should go free
                          G                C      G
    Well, I'll follow his footsteps up the narrow way
           G                         D             G
    And be ready to meet him when he calls on that day

      [n.c.]       G
    I hear a voice calling, it must be our Lord
    He's calling from heaven on high
    I hear a voice calling, I've gained the reward
    In the land where we never shall die.

    He died on the cross, that old rugged cross
    So we should be saved in our sins and our loss
    So I'll follow his footsteps up the narrow way
    And be ready to meet him when he calls on that day

    I hear a voice calling, it must be our Lord
    He's calling from heaven on high
    I hear a voice calling, I've gained the reward
    In the land where we never shall die.
    In the land where we never shall die.
                                     C/g    G
    In the land where we never shall die.

    C                           F           C
     I hear a voice calling, it must be our Lord [it must be, it must be our lord]
                               G
    It's coming from heaven on high
      C                          F            C
    I hear a voice calling, I've gained the reward [I've gained, I've gained the reward]
                          G           C
    For the land where we never shall die

        C                  F               C
    The Saviour has paid a great price for me
                        D7   G       (G7)
    He gave his life on Calvary
            C                           F      C
    So I'll follow his footsteps up the narrow way
           C                         G             C
    And be ready to meet him when he calls on that day

    I hear a voice calling, it must be our Lord
    It's coming from heaven on high
    I hear a voice calling, I've gained the reward
    For the land where we never shall die.

    He died on the cross, the old rugged cross
                                D7          G         G7
    That we would be saved from sin and our loss
    So I'll follow his footsteps up the narrow way
    And we'll pay our debts on that great judgement day *)

    I hear a voice calling, it must be our Lord
    It's coming from heaven on high
    I hear a voice calling, I've gained the reward
    For the land where we never shall die.

\*) More theologically correct would, I suppose, be: “And *he'll* pay
our debts . . .”, but they clearly sing “we'll . . .”
