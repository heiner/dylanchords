Written by Bob Dylan, I guess  
Performed by Bob Dylan and the Band in the Basement, summer 1967  
Tabbed by Simon Bedford and Eyolf Ã˜strem

There were two takes, and since they are virutally identical, I'll
present both...

The chords are written as if played with a capo on the 1st or the 3rd
fret (for the two takes). On the recordings the guitar part is played
with barre chords higher up on the neck.

           G      Am     Bm    Am
    If the farmer has no silo
            G         Am      Bm    Am
    And his fuel cost runs up high
    G                     Am           Bm       Am
    Well, that's just how much I would love you
       G          Am          Bm    Am
    if you'd just only let me try

    C Am
    in some nice young up-to-date kitchen
    C                     Am
    let us get aquainted, dear
             G         Am                    Bm      Am
    and them old floor-birds would just quit eatin'
             C         D         G
    And just grin from ear toear

    Two floor birds and a prudent baby chick, yes that's me
    That ain't much to bust
    But restriction causes damage
    And damage causes lust

    So, poor little girl, come blow this horn
    Hard as any horn might seem
    It's very easily done, actually
    All you have to do is dream.

    [instrumental verse]

    Well, the whole back-strappers are a dime a dozen
    And I can get a cup for a nickle
    Yes, but look what an earful I get and it's all awful too
    Everytime I try to go get me a little tickle

    So, give me one sweet loaf of bread
    just one sweet loaf, I'll fill it up and I'll be gone
    Yes, just like some of these old floor birds
    who fly from dawn to dawn
    who fly from dawn to dawn
    who fly from dawn to dawn
    who fly from dawn to dawn

    flies from dawn to dawn (look at that crazy floor-bird, he just...)
    flies from dawn to dawn (what a floor-bird, he...)
    flies from dawn to dawn.
