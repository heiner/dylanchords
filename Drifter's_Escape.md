         G                      *
    "Oh, help me in my weakness,"
                C/g     G     *
    I heard the drifter say,
            G
    As they carried him from the courtroom
                    C/g  G     *
    And were taking him away.
        G
    "My trip hasn't been a pleasant one
                   C/g         *
    And my time it isn't long,

    And I still do not know
                     C/g       G
    What it was that I've done wrong."

    Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside,
    A tear came to his eye,
    "You fail to understand," he said,
    "Why must you even try?"
    Outside, the crowd was stirring,
    You could hear it from the door.
    Inside, the judge was stepping down,
    While the jury cried for more.

    "Oh, stop that cursed jury,"
    Cried the attendant and the nurse,
    "The trial was bad enough,
    But this is ten times worse."
    Just then a bolt of lightning
    Struck the courthouse out of shape,
    And while ev'rybody knelt to pray
    The drifter did escape.
