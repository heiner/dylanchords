    Honey, we could be in Kansas
    A                             E
    By time the snow begins to thaw.

    They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn
    They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn
    But you wouldn't know it by me
    Every day's been darkness since you been gone.

    Little rooster crowin', there must be something on his mind
    Little rooster crowin', there must be something on his mind
    Well, I feel just like that rooster
    Honey, ya treat me so unkind.

    The birds are flyin' low babe, honey I feel so exposed
    Well, the birds are flyin' low babe, honey I feel so exposed
    Well now, I ain't got any matches
    And the station doors are closed.

    Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above
    Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above
    Well, you know I even outran the hound dogs
    Honey, you know I've earned your love.

    Look at the sun sinkin' like a ship
    Look at the sun sinkin' like a ship
    Ain't that just like my heart, babe
    When you kissed my lips?
