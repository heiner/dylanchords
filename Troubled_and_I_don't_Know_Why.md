        C
    I'm troubled and I don't know why
        F                         C
    I'm troubled and I don't know why
                      G       F          G
    the trouble on my mind is driving me blind
        F              G          C
    I'm troubled and I don't know why

    Oh, what did the morning say?
    Oh, what did the morning say?
    Well, it rolled from the night with a dark dreary light
    Sayin' another old weary day

    What did the newspaper tell?
    What did the newspaper tell?
    Well, it rolled in the door and it layed on the floor
    Sayin' things ain't goin' so well

    What did the television squall?
    What did the television squall?
    Well, it roared and it boomed and it bounced around the room
    and it never said nothing at all

    What did the moviescreen lecture?
    What did the moviescreen lecture?
    Well, it heated and it froze and it took off all its clothes
    and I left in the middle of the picture
