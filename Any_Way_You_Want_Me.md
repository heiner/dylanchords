    A                   F#m
    I'll be strong as a mountain,
    D                      A
    Or weak as a willow tree,
    A    A7/c#   D       D#o
     Any way you want me,
    A          E      A    Asus4 A
    That's how I will be.

    I'll be as tame as a baby,
    Or wild as the raging sea,
    Any way you want me,
    Well, that's how I will be.

    D             A
     In your hands my heart is clay,
    D                    A
     Take an hold as you may.
    B
     I'm what you make me, you've only to take me,
                            E
    And in your arms I will stay.

    I'll be a fool or a wise man,
    My darling you hold the key,
    Yes, any way you want me,
    That's how I will be.

    D         A
    I will be.
