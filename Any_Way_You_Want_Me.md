A                   F#m
I'll be strong as a mountain,
D                      A
Or weak as a willow tree,
A    A7/c#   D       D#o
 Any way you want me,
A          E      A    Asus4 A
That's how I will be.

I'll be as tame as a baby,
Or wild as the raging sea,
Any way you want me,
Well, that's how I will be.

D             A
 In your hands my heart is clay,
D                    A
 Take an hold as you may.

 I'm what you make me, you've only to take me,
                        E
And in your arms I will stay.
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
I'll be a fool or a wise man,
My darling you hold the key,
Yes, any way you want me,
That's how I will be.

D         A
I will be.
