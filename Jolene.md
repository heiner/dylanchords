If you absolutely want to play this on a single guitar, and at least <i>
try</i> to include the lick in the refrain, the easiest thing to do is
to play it with a capo on the 6th fret, hence the chords below.
Otherwise, pick any key and play a [Help:Roadmaps\#shuffle regular
shuffle](/wiki/Help:Roadmaps#shuffle_regular_shuffle "wikilink") with the
straight three-chord chords.

    The lick (play at *):
      :     .     .     .       :     .     .     .
    |-------------3---2-------|-------------------------|
    |-------------------5---3-|-5-----------------------|
    |-------------------------|-------2---2-------------|
    |-------------------------|-------------------------|
    |-------------------------|-------------------------|
    |-------------------------|-------------------------|

    Without the capo:
      :     .     .     .       :     .     .     .
    |-------------9---8-------|-------------------------|

Capo 6th fret (sounding key E flat major)

                A
    Well you're comin' down High Street,

    walkin' in the sun

    You make the dead man rise,

    and holler she's the one

    Baby, I am the king and you're the queen

    Well it's a long old highway, don't ever end
    I've got a Saturday night special, I'm back again
    I'll sleep by your door, lay my life on the line
    You probably don't know, but I'm gonna make you mine
    Jolene, Jolene
    Baby, I am the king and you're the queen

    I keep my hands in my pocket, I'm movin' along
    People think they know, but they're all wrong
    You're something nice, I'm gonna grab my dice
    I can't say I haven't paid the price
    Jolene, Jolene
    Baby I am the king and you're the queen

    Well I found out the hard way, I've had my fill
    You can't find somebody with his back to a hill
    Those big brown eyes, they set off a spark
    When you hold me in your arms things don't look so dark
    Jolene, Jolene
    Baby I am the king and you're the queen
