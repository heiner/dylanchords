    "Is it rollin', Bob?"

    [n.c.]           E
    To be alone with you
                 A
    Just you and me
                          E
    Now won't you tell me true
                                 B
    Ain't that the way it oughta be?
                       E
    To hold each other tight
                    A
    the whole night through
                         E
    Ev'rything is always right
    B                    E    [turnaround]
     When I'm alone with you.

    To be alone with you
    At the close of the day
    With only you in view
    While evening slips away
    It only goes to show
    That while life's pleasures be few
    The only one I know
    Is when I'm alone with you.

                  A
    They say that nighttime is the right time
       E
    To be with the one you love
        F#
    Too many thoughts get in the way in the day
               B      [n.c.]
    But you're always what I'm thinkin' of

    I wish the night was here
    Bringin' me all of your charms
    When only you are near
    To hold me in your arms.
    I'll always thank the Lord
    When my working day's through
    I get my sweet reward
    To be alone with you.
