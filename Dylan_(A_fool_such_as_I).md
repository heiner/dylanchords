<div id="intro">
An album put together out of leftovers from the sessions for <em>Self
Portrait</em> and <em>New Morning</em> (not necessarily the best
leftovers either), behind Dylan's back, maybe as some kind of revenge
from Columbia, after Dylan had signed with David Geffen's new
<em>Asylum</em> label. An offical bootleg album, if you like.

Apparently this one is hard to find these days. Maybe it doesn't matter
. . .
