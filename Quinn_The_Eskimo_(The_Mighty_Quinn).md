<pre class="verse">
C

C           F                C             F
Ev'rybody's building the big ships and the boats,
C                 F
Some are building monuments,
C                       F
Others are jotting down notes,
C                F
Ev'rybody's in despair,
C                 F
Ev'ry girl and boy
         C                G
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here,
F                            C
Ev'rybody's [gonna] jump for joy.
</pre>

<pre class="refrain">
C                 G            C
Come all without, come all within,
       C       G                F      C
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn.
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I likes my sugar sweet,
But guarding fumes and making haste, *)
It ain't my cup of meat.
Ev'rybody's just standin' round 'neath the trees,
Feeding pigeons on a limb
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here,
them pigeons'll go to him.
</pre>

<pre class="refrain">
Come all without, come all within,
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn.
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
A lamp gate, a gunny dew, I can't recite them all **)
Just tell me where it hurts ***)
And I'll tell you who to call
Nobody can get no sleep,
There's someone on ev'ryone's toes
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here,
Ev'rybody's gonna doze.
</pre>

<pre class="refrain">
Come all without, come all within,
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn.
</pre>
