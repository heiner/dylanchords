Words and music Bob Dylan (I presume)  
Sung (if that's what it's called) by Dylan and the Band in the Basement,
1967  
Tabbed and transcribed by Eyolf Ã˜strem

Capo 2nd fret (sounding key D major)

Words in parentheses ( ) are the mostly spoken interjections of the Band
(is it Richard Manuel?).  
Words in brackets [ ] are Dylan's spoken words.  
I haven't written out the laughter, because it's all over the place.
