    G

    Sent him off to prison
    For a seventy-dollar robbery.
    Closed the door behind him
    And they threw away the key.
    Lord, Lord, They cut George Jackson down.
    Lord, Lord,
    They laid him in the ground.

    He wouldn't take shit from no one
    He wouldn't bow down or kneel.
    Authorities, they hated him
    Because he was just too real.
    Lord, Lord,
    They cut George Jackson down.
    Lord, Lord,
    They laid him in the ground.

    Prison guards, they cursed him
    As they watched him from above
    But they were frightened of his power
    They were scared of his love.
    Lord, Lord,
    So they cut George Jackson down.
    Lord, Lord,
    They laid him in the ground.

    Sometimes I think this whole world
    Is one big prison yard.
    Some of us are prisoners
    The rest of us are guards.
    Lord, Lord,
    They cut George Jackson down.
    Lord, Lord,
    They laid him in the ground.
