             G          C           G
The water is wide and I can't cross over 
        Em              D
Neither have I wings to fly 
[n.c]      Bm                  C
Build me a boat that can carry two 
               G  D            C G/b Am G (C/g G) 
And both shall row my love and I. 

There is a ship and it sails on the sea 
Loaded deep as deep can be 
But not as deep as the love I'm in 
I know not if I sink or swim. 

I leaned my back up against an oak 
Thinkin' it was a trusty tree 
But first it bent and then it broke 
Just like my own false love to me. 

Oh love is gentle, love is kind 
Gay as a jewel when first it's new 
But love grows old and waxes cold 
And fades away like some morning dew. 

The water is wide and I can't cross over
Neither have I wings to fly
Build me a boat that can carry two
And both shall row my love and I.
