Flow'r of the hazel glade, Eileen Aroon.

Were she no longer true
Eileen Aroon
What would her lover do
Eileen Aroon
Fly with a broken chain
far cross the sounding main
Never to love again, Eileen Aroon.

Who in the time so fleet
Eileen Aroon
Who in the song so sweet
Eileen Aroon
Dearer her charms to me
dearer her laughter free
Dearer her constancy
Eileen Aroon.

Youth will in time decay
Eileen Aroon
Beauty must fade away
Eileen Aroon
Castles are sacked in war
chieftains are scattered far
Truth is a fixed star
Eileen Aroon.

<pre class="verse">
1. When, like the early rose, 
Eileen aroon! 
Beauty in childhood blows; 
Eileen aroon! 
When, like a diadem, 
Buds blush around the stem, 
Which is the fairest gem? 
Eileen aroon! 

2. Is it the laughing eye? 
Eileen aroon! 
Is it the timid sigh? 
Eileen aroon! 
Is it the tender tone, 
Soft as the string'd harp's moan? 
Oh, it is the truth alone. 
Eileen aroon! 

3. When, like the rising [/dawning] day, 
Eileen aroon! 
Love sends his early ray, 
Eileen aroon! 
What makes his dawning glow 
Changeless through joy or woe? 
Only the constant know - 
Eileen aroon!
