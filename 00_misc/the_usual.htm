A
I'm trippin over dumb drunks at a party
F                      G                 A
My girlfriend just ran off with the DJ
A
I'd give her everything I had, but she refused it
F                        G                         A
It don't matter now, she don't know how to use it
C
My confidence is dwindling
D
Look at the shape I'm in
C
Where's my pearls, where's the swine?
D                                           (n.c.)
I'm not thirsty, but I'm standing in line.
                    A
I'll have the usual

Yeah, I'll have the usual

Fifty silhouettes now tumblin' on the dance floor
Pink elephants fallin' through a trap door
Sixty cigarettes a day because I'm nervous
When will that bitch begin to serve us?
I used to be a good boy, livin' the good life
Fifty thousand kisses later she was a housewife
She was good, I was unkind
I'm not thirsty, but I'm standin' in line
I'll have the usual, yeah
I'll have the usual

Big Jim says that the second comin's comin'
I think he must be seein' double or something
You can hang around here, waiting for the offerings<br />
 I can't win, but I've seen enough, man
A fifth of whisky keep the doctor away
A little more and it's judgment day
I had a future, but she just passed out
I'm gonna drink until I see what am I talkin' about
I'll have the usual, yeah<br />
 I'll have the usual
I'll have the usual
Yeah, the usual
