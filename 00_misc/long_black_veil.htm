<h1 class="songtitle">Long Black Veil</h1>


<p>Written by M.J.Wilkin and D.Dil<br /> 
Performed twice by Bob Dylan, in Wheeling, West Virginia, 28 April
1997 (electric) and in George, Washington, June 17, 2000 (acoustic)<br />
Tabbed by Eyolf &Oslash;strem</p>

<p>Below is the acoustic version from 2000. The electric version is
played in E (chords: E, B and A), and it's much slower. Otherwise it's
basically the same arrangement.</p>

C               (Csus4 C)
Ten years ago on a     cold dark night
G                           F            C
Someone was shot 'neath the town hall light 
    C           Csus4         C           Csus4 C 
The people who saw, well they all agreed
         G                        F          C   Csus4 C
That the slayer that ran looked a lot like me 

The judge said &quot;Son, what is your alibi? 
If you were somewhere else you won't have to die&quot; 
I spoke not a word though it meant my life 
I had been in the arms of my best friend's wife 
</pre>

<pre class="refrain">
    F           C          F          C
She walks these hills in a long black veil 
F         C              F           C
Visits my grave when the night winds wail 
C                F      C
Nobody knows and nobody sees 
F      G         C     Csus4 C
Nobody knows but me 

C . . . | C . . . |

<pre class="verse">
The scaffold was high, eternity near 
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear 
But sometimes at night when the cold wind moans 
In a long black veil she shivers over my bones 
</pre>

<pre class="refrain">
She walks these hills in a long black veil 
Visits my grave when the night winds wail 
Nobody knows, nobody sees 
Nobody knows but me
