<pre class="refrain">
C     
This world can't stand that long
F              C
Be ready don't wait too late
G
You should know it can't stand long
                      C
For it is too full of hate
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
For a long time this world has stood
Gets more wicked every day
the maker who created it
Surely won't let it stand this way
</pre>

<pre class="refrain">
This world can't stand too long
Be ready don't wait too late
You should know it can't stand long
For it is too full of hate
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
This world's been destroyed before
Cause it is too full of sin
For that very reason
It will be destroyed again
</pre>

<pre class="refrain">
This world it can't stand long
Be ready don't wait too late
You should know it can't stand long
For it is too full of hate
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
If we only give our hearts to God
Let him lead us by the hand
Nothing in this world to fear
He'll lead you across the golden sand
</pre>

<pre class="refrain">
This world it can't stand long
Be ready don't wait too late
You should know it can't stand long
For it is too full of hate
</pre>
