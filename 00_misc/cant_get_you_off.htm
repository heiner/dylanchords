<pre class="verse">
         C             G         C
   Oh, I can't get you off of my mind
          C                        G
   When I try, I'm just wasting my time
              C              C7
   Lord, I've tried and I've tried
   F                   D7
   All night long I've cried
         C             G         C
   But I can't get you off of my mind.

Didn't think you would leave me behind
But I guess you're the two-timin' kind
Do you think that it's smart 
to jump from heart to heart
When I can't get you off of my mind.

   Oh, I can't get you off of my mind
   When I try, I'm just wasting my time
   Lord, I've tried and I've tried
   All night long I've cried
   But I can't get you off of my mind.

You believe that a true love is blind
So you fool ev'ry new love you find
You've got stars in your eyes 
but they can't hide the lies
Oh, I can't get you off my mind.

   Oh, I can't get you off of my mind
   When I try, I'm just wasting my time
   Lord, I've tried and I've tried
   All night long I've cried
   But I can't get you off of my mind.
