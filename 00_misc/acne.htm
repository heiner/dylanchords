<h1 class="songtitle">Acne</h1>


<p>Written by Eric von Schmidt (probably &ndash; anyway, it's probably not
what he considers his major contribution to humanity either, so he may
be able to forgive me if the attribution is wrong)<br />
Performed by Dylan and Ramblin' Jack Elliott at the Riverside Church,
Jul 29 1961<br />
Tabbed by Eyolf &Oslash;strem</p>

<p>The Do-wap thing is Elliott's assigned role throughout the song.<br />
Things get a little out of hand towards the end of the song; I've
indicated the chords in the third verse</p>
