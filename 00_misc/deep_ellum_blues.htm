<h1 class="songtitle">Deep Ellem Blues</h1>


<p>Written by Joe &amp; Bob Attlesay (but credited to Big Joe Williams by
Dylan)<br />
Performed live by Bob Dylan on April 16, 1962 at Gerde's Folk City<br /> 
Tabbed by Eyolf &Oslash;strem</p>

<hr />

<p>The track begins with a lot of tuning; the guitar has been in open E
tuning before the song begins...<br />
In the first verse, Dylan reverses the basic strumming pattern (G6 - G
- G6 - G etc.)</p>


<p>The basic strumming pattern:</p>
