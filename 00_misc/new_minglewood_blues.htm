<pre class="verse">
A

      A
I was born in a desert, Raised in a lion's den
      D7                A
I was born in a desert, Raised in a lion's den
       E                                                        A
And my number one occupation is stealing women from their other men

D7                   C7                         A
Busted down in Texas, busted jail, I'm gone for good
D7                   C7                            A
Busted down in Texas, busted jail and I'm gone for good
         E                                                              A
Well the sheriff couldn't catch me but his little girl sure wished they could

[instr. verse]

Doc says I'm crazy, some says I am some says I ain't
Doctor says I'm crazy, some says I am some says I ain't
The little girl says I'm [a sinner]**), but the preacherman calls me a saint

[instr. verse]

Got lots of whiskey, [...] start lookin' good  *)
Got lots of whiskey, [...] start lookin' good
Couple more shots of whiskey, I'm goin' back to Minglewood

Doc says I'm crazy, some says I am some says I ain't
Doctor says I'm crazy, some says I am some says I ain't
The preacher calls me a sinner, but the little girl she calls me a saint

<p>*) Dylan's lyrics are inaudible (to me anyway). The Grateful Dead's
version goes:</p>

<pre class="verse">
&ldquo;Well, a couple shots of whiskey, women round here start looking good<br />
 Well, a couple shots of whiskey, women round here start looking good<br />
 A couple more shots of whiskey, I'm going down to Minglewood&rdquo;
</pre>
<p>**) Dylan sings something else &ndash; probably intending to sing the same
as in the last verse.
