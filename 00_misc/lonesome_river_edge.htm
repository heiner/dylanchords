<h1 class="songtitle">Lonesome River Edge</h1>

<p>Trad. <br />
Performed by Bob Dylan on the so-called Banjo tape, recorded in the basement of Gerde's folk city Feb 8, 1963, with Happy Traum<br />
Tabbed by Eyolf &Oslash;strem </p>
<hr />

<p>The guitar is slightly low on this one, perhaps as much as a semitone.<br />
  It's hard to tell if the Em on &quot;good-bye&quot; is a mistake or just an intentional short Em like the at &quot;lips&quot;.</p>

           G    
I held her hand 
     C           G
on a cobblestone corner, 
             Em G 
I kissed her lips 
       C     G
by the river bridge
           (Em) G
I said good-bye     
      C            G
with a night train rolling
              C D
on a lonesome day 
                C     G
by the lonesome river edge.
