Tell me what kind of friend is this

What kind of friend is this?
Who loves me behind my back
What kind of friend is this
Shows up every place I've been
She act kind of 'lone

She making a loan
But you know she won't
She got a language [in] the morning
And she's making it on my bed
Aw, what kind of friend is this.

What kind of friend is this
Losing up anything
Back off, [boy]
When she goes down

pack of beens
Tell me what kind of friend is this?
