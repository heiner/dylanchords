<h1 class="songtitle">It's Hard To Be Blind</h1>


<p>Trad. (this version attributed to Rev. Gary Davis)<br /> 
Played by Bob Dylan on the so-called Minnesota Party Tape II (May
1961) and Minnesota Hotel Tape (Dec 1961)<br />
Tabbed by Eyolf &Oslash;strem</p>

<hr />

<h2 class="songversion">Minnesota Party Tape II (May 1961)</h2>

<p>Capo 2nd fret (sounding key D major)</p>

<p>The guitar accompaniment has a fairly steady oompa-bass, as
exemplified in the tab snipped below. <br />
The F is frequently played with the little flourish in the second
measure below (indicated with an asterisk in the chord section).<br />
There are instrumental verses before, between, and after, which are
more or less identical to the tabbed version.</p>
