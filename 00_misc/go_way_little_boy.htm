D        A  D

               D 
Go 'way little boy 
A           D 
I'm not for you 
D  Bm      G 
Go back to her 
      D         Bm     G 
Where you'll be more secure 
D                  C             Bm 
She knows you much better than I do 
               D 
Go 'way little boy 
A           D 
I'm not for you 
  
Go 'way little boy 
You're making me sad 
I don't wanna see you bleed 
She's the one that you need 
You'll never miss what you ain't never had 
Go 'way little boy 
You're making me sad 
Go way little boy 
It's much too late 
Walk back out the door 
Dont wanna see you no more 
You're making it hard for me to concentrate 
Go 'way little boy 
It's much too late

Bm        /a#       /a   /g# 
Can't you hear your mama callin' 
          G    A        D 
Don't you recognize her voice 
  Bm          /a#    /a       /g# 
I think you'd better heed her warning 
      G                  Em 
While you still have the choice
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
Go way little boy 
You're much too late 
Your future's bright 
Dont throw it away tonight 
It's getting hard for me to look you in the eye 
Go 'way little boy 
you're makin' me cry
