<hr />

<p>Two things are noteworthy from the guitaristic side. One is the
continuously sounding -----3 (highest string, third fret), throughout
most of the chords (see chord chart). The other is the bitonality of
the second chord. Where I've written a G/b chord, some of the
instruments play a Bm chord, which clashes with the -----3. There are
some ways of approximating that on a single guitar, but none are
completely satisfying; see suggestions below.<br />
Apart from that, it's an interesting tune for three reasons: the
difference between the two types of verses, which are so similar that
it's hard to keep them apart, but still quite distinct; the irregular
strophe structure, with the secondary verse form occurring three
times, with a different number of &ldquo;regular&rdquo; verses in between. The
third reason is more elusive, but despite its extreme simplicity, with
basically the same chord sequence (Am7-G/b-C-D, reversed in the
bridge) for just about every line, it still works wonderfully.</p>

<p>Capo 1st fret (sounding key Ab major)</p>

<p>Chords:</p>
<pre class="chords">
C      x32013
G/b    x20003 or x20033
Am7    x02213 or x02013
Dsus4  xx0233
Dsus2  xx0230
Cadd9  x32033
Bm     x24432 (alternative to G/b)
Bm+G/b x24433 (hard)
       xx4433 (not so hard, but misses the bass note)
       x20002 (easy, but misses the high -----3)
       79978x (easy enough, but the move to the high position isn't ideal)

I look into the eyes of my merciful friend
And then i ask myself, is this the end?
Memories linger, sad yet sweet
And I think of the souls in heaven who will meet

<pre class="verse">
Along the dim Atlantic line
the ravaged land lies for miles behind
The light's coming forward and the streets are broad
All must yield to the avenging God

<pre class="bridge">
The world is old, the world is gray 
Lessons of life, can't be learned in a day 
I watch and I wait, and I listen while I stand 
To the music that comes from a far-better land

<pre class="verse">
Close the eyes of our captain, peace may he know 
His long night is done, the great leader is laid low 
He was ready to fall, he was quick to defend 
Killed outright he was, by his own men 

C . . . G . C . G . . .

It's the last day's last hour, of the last happy year 
I feel that the unknown world is so near 
Pride will vanish and glory will rot 
But virtue lives and cannot be forgot 

C . . . G . . . D . . .

The bells of leavening have rung 
There's blasphemy on every tongue 
Let 'em say that I walked in fair nature's light 
And that I was loyal to truth and to right

<pre class="bridge">
Serve God and be cheerful, look upward, beyond 
Beyond the darkness of masks, the surprises of dawn 
In the deep green grasses of the blood stained world 
They never dreamed of surrenderin', they fell where they stood

<pre class="verse">
Stars fell over Alabama, I saw each star 
You're walkin' in dreams, whoever you are
Chilled are the skies, keen as the frost 
The ground's froze hard and the morning is lost 

C . . . G . C . G . . .

A letter to mother came today 
Gunshot wound to the breast is what it did say 
But he'll be better soon, he's in a hospital bed 
But he'll never be better - he's already dead 

C . . . G . C . G . . .

I'm ten miles outside the city, and I'm lifted away 
In an ancient light, that is not of day 
They were calm, they were blunt, we knew 'em all too well 
We loved each other more than we ever dared to tell
