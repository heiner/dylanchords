<p>Trad. <br /> 
Recorded and filmed by Bob Dylan w/band for <em>Masked and
Anonymous</em> (2003)<br />
Tabbed by Eyolf &Oslash;strem</p>

<hr />

<p><em>Diamond Jo</em> was the name of a steamboat that ran on the upper
Mississippi in the period 1864-83, owned by &ldquo;Diamond Jo&rdquo;
Reynolds. (He also built his own railroad from Malvern to Hot Springs
(Arkansas, I believe), after a painful carriage trip to cure his
rheumatism in the healing waters of Hot Springs). The refrain line
&ldquo;Diamond Jo come and get me&rdquo; could be a reference to the boat. <br />
Early versions of the song recorded by the Georgia Crackers (1927) and
Charlie Butler (1937), then a prisoner at the Parchman prison.<br />
