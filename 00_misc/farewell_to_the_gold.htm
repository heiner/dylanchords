<pre class="verse">
D        Em7   C                D    
Shotover River, your gold it is waning 
         C(add9)         D          G       D
And it's years since the color I've seen. 
D           Em7      C         D
No use just sitting, Lady Luck blaming 
     C(add9)     D            G       C/g  G
I'll pack up and make a break clean. 
</pre>

<pre class="refrain">
D               Dsus4 D      G       D
Farewell to the gold    that never I found, 
    D          Dsus4 D      G          D
Goodbye to the nuggets that somewhere abound; 
         G         C             G         D
For it's only when dreaming that I see you gleaming 
     C           D         G 
Down in the dark deep underground.

<pre class="verse">
It's nearly three years since I left my old mother 
For adventure and gold by the pound. 
With Jimmy the prospector, he was another, 
For the hills of Otago we were bound. 
</pre>

<pre class="refrain">
Farewell . . .
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
We worked the Cardrona's dry valley all over 
Old Jimmy Williams and me. 
They were panning good dust on the winding shotover 
So we headed down there just to see. 
</pre>

<pre class="refrain">
Farewell . . .
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
We sluiced and we cradled for day after day 
Barely making enough to get by; 
Then a terrible flood swept poor Jimmy away 
During six stormy days in July. 
</pre>

<pre class="refrain">
Farewell . . .
