<h1 class="songtitle">On A Rainy Afternoon/Does She Need Me?/I Can't Leave Her Behind</h1>


<p>Written by Bob Dylan (and Robbie Robertson, I assume)<br /> 
Filmed in an unknown hotel room during the 1966 tour, and saved for
posterity on <em>Eat The Document</em><br />
Lyrics transcribed by Tobias Levander and Arild Langseth (&ldquo;I Can't
Leave Her Behind&rdquo;).<br />
Tabbed by Eyolf &Oslash;strem</p>

<p>This is one of the most charming tunes that Dylan has never written --
too bad he didn't finish it. It is also a fascinating study in the
development of song, and in Dylan's composing technique. I assume that
the version called &ldquo;On a rainy afternoon&rdquo; or &ldquo;Does she need me?&rdquo;
comes first &ndash; the &ldquo;twice as slow&rdquo; version with the duple time rhythm
that grows out of this, is what appears in &ldquo;I can't leave her
behind&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Dylan's guitar is tuned in drop C (C-A-d-g-b-e'), capoed on the fifth
fret, Robbie's is in standard tuning.</p>

<p>The main transcription uses Robbie's guitar. Bbmaj7 = xx8765</p>

Dylan: &ldquo;No, keep going, we got to get it all. We're gonna play it all
anyway. The ending shouldn't be . . . The ending should go like this
-- here's how the melody should go, cause remember the melody
now. Everything's alright until the last phrase.&rdquo;</p>
