<pre class="verse">

 The judge decreed it, the clerk he wrote it

The clerk he wrote it down indeedy *)
C                                            G 
 The judge decreed it, the clerk he wrote it down 
         D                   C                   G 
Give you this jail sentence, you'll be Nashville bound 

Some got six months, some got one solid 
Some got one solid year, indeedy 
Some got six months, some got one solid year 
But me and my buddy both got lifetime here 

Fix my supper mama, I wanna go to 
I wanna go to bed indeed Lord 
Fix my supper, I wanna go to bed 
I've been drinking White Lightning, And it's gone to my head

<p>*) Dylan actually sings &ldquo;The judge decreed it down indeedy&rdquo; here.
