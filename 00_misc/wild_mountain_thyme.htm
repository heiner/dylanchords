Oh the summertime is coming
        F                  C
And the leaves are sweetly blooming
        F             C
And the wild mountain thyme
        Dm               F
Blooms around the purple heather.
         C   F      C
Will you go, lassie, go.

If my true love she won't go,
I will surely find another
To pull wild mountain thyme
From all around the purple heather.
Will you go, lassie, go.
</pre>

<pre class="refrain">
          F        C
And we'll all go together
        F             C
To pull wild mountain thyme
          Dm               F
From all around the purple heather.
         C   F      C
Will you go, lassie, go.  
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
I will build my love a tower   *)
At the foot of yonder mountain  *)
And then on it I will put
All the flowers of the mountain
Will you go, lassie, go.
</pre>

<pre class="refrain">
And we'll all go together
To pull wild mountain thyme
From all around the purple heather.
Will you go, lassie, go.

<p>*) Several other versions have &ldquo;bower&rdquo; and &ldquo;fountain&rdquo; here, but
this seems to be what they sing.
