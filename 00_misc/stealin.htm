<p>*) In the harp interludes, the figure at &ldquo;If you don't think I'm . . .&rdquo; goes:</p>
<pre class="tab">
  G D C  D  C G
  :   .   .   .    
|-7-5-3--2--0-3---|
|-8-7-5--3--1-0---|
|-7-7-5--2--0-0---| repeat
|-----------2-0---|

<p>Also, the A in the refrains is only used in the harp interludes, and
the G-G7 are twice as short there.</p>
