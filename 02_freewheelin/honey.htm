G   
Honey, just allow me one more chance
   C              G
To get along with you.
G             
Honey, just allow me one more chance,
      A7              D   
Ah'll do anything for you.
            G
Well, I'm a-walkin' down the road
        G7
With my head in my hand,
    C 
I'm lookin' for a woman
        A7
Needs a worried man.
       G        D       G   C
Just-a one kind favor I ask you,
G              D        G
'Low me just-a one more chance.

[1 verse harmonica solo]

Honey, just allow me one more chance
To ride your aeroplane.
Honey, just allow me one more chance
To ride your passenger train.
Well, I've been lookin' all over
For a gal like you,
I can't find nobody
So you'll have to do.
Just-a one kind favor I ask you,
'Low me just-a one more chance.

[1 verse harmonica solo]

Honey, just allow me one more chance
To get along with you.
Honey, just allow me one more chance,
Ah'll do anything with you.
Well, lookin' for a woman
That ain't got no man,
Is just lookin' for a needle
That is lost in the sand.
Just-a one kind favor I ask you,
'Low me just-a one more chance.

[1 verse harmonica solo]

It's just-a one kind favor I ask you,
'Low me just-a one more chance.
