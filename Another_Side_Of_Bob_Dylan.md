<h2>Introductory Remarks </h2>
    <h3>Eyolf Østrem</h3>
<em>Another Side Of Bob Dylan </em>was recorded during one glorious, nightly session on
June 9 1964, over a bottle of Beaujolais – and it shows… The album may be a “rich,
complex album” and a proof of his “genius”, as Paul Williams and Paul Cable
have it, but – for once – Clinton Heylin may have given the most adequate description, as
“a typical Dylan session – flashes of sheer brilliance, improvisational flair, songs
coming together and falling apart (in fairly equal measure) – in the studio” (Heylin: <em>Dylan
Behind Closed Doors, the Recording Sessions [1960–1994]</em>). In other words: he can’t be
all right all the time.

In several of the songs, most notably in <em>[[Ballad in Plain D]] </em>and <em>[[My Back Pages]], </em>it is evident that
Dylan hasn’t really learnt the chord changes properly before he started recording. In
these two songs it is difficult to find two verses that are played in the same way. There
are lots of temporary solutions. True enough, the variations work out quite well, but it
would be over-indulgent to call them planned…

Apart from this, it is interesting to note how a few guitaristic specialties recur in
song after song. One is the use of the chord changes C/d – G/d (xx0553 – xx0433), as in [[All I Really Want to Do]], slightly varied in [[I Don't Believe You (She Acts Like We Never Have Met)]], and most beautifully in [[Chimes of Freedom]]. Another is the progression xx0430 -
xx0210 – 320003 which occurs both in [[All I Really Want to Do]]
and in [[Spanish Harlem Incident]]. And the most persistent
of these “tricks” is the figure G-G6-G7 found in [[To Ramona]], [[My Back Pages]], [[I Don't Believe You (She Acts Like We Never Have Met)]] and [[Ballad in Plain D]]<em>. </em>Add
to this that all of the songs (except, of course, the piano song [[Black Crow Blues]]) are played in G or C, with an occasional
capo, and you have an album which is quite simple, guitaristically speaking.

Then there is the genius, of course.
