## Introductory Remarks

### Eyolf Østrem

_Another Side Of Bob Dylan_ was recorded during one glorious,
nightly session on June 9 1964, over a bottle of Beaujolais – and it
shows… The album may be a “rich, complex album” and a proof of his
“genius”, as Paul Williams and Paul Cable have it, but – for once –
Clinton Heylin may have given the most adequate description, as “a
typical Dylan session – flashes of sheer brilliance, improvisational
flair, songs coming together and falling apart (in fairly equal measure)
– in the studio” (Heylin: <em>Dylan Behind Closed Doors, the Recording
Sessions [1960–1994]</em>). In other words: he can’t be all right all
the time.

In several of the songs, most notably in <em>[Ballad in Plain
D](Ballad in Plain D) </em>and <em>[My Back
Pages](My Back Pages), </em>it is evident that Dylan hasn’t
really learnt the chord changes properly before he started recording. In
these two songs it is difficult to find two verses that are played in
the same way. There are lots of temporary solutions. True enough, the
variations work out quite well, but it would be over-indulgent to call
them planned…

Apart from this, it is interesting to note how a few guitaristic
specialties recur in song after song. One is the use of the chord
changes C/d – G/d (xx0553 – xx0433), as in [All I Really Want to
Do](All I Really Want to Do), slightly varied in [I Don't
Believe You (She Acts Like We Never Have
Met)](I Don't Believe You (She Acts Like We Never Have Met)),
and most beautifully in [Chimes of
Freedom](Chimes of Freedom). Another is the progression
xx0430 - xx0210 – 320003 which occurs both in [All I Really Want to
Do](All I Really Want to Do) and in [Spanish Harlem
Incident](Spanish Harlem Incident). And the most persistent
of these “tricks” is the figure G-G6-G7 found in [To
Ramona](To Ramona), [My Back
Pages](My Back Pages), [I Don't Believe You (She Acts Like We
Never Have
Met)](I Don't Believe You (She Acts Like We Never Have Met))
and [Ballad in Plain D](Ballad in Plain D)<em>. </em>Add to
this that all of the songs (except, of course, the piano song [Black
Crow Blues](Black Crow Blues)) are played in G or C, with an
occasional capo, and you have an album which is quite simple,
guitaristically speaking.

Then there is the genius, of course.
