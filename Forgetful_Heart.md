    F . . . | F . E7 . | Am . . . | . . .

       .      Am
    Forgetful heart,

    lost your power of recall.
                 Dm
    Every little detail
                      Am
    you don’t remember at all.
                 F
    The times we knew,
                E7     Am
    who would remember better than you?

    Forgetful heart,
    we laughed and had a good time, you and I.
    It’s been so long.
    Now you’re content to let the days go by.
    When you were there,
    you were the answer to my prayer.

    Forgetful heart,
    we loved with all the love that life can give.
    What can I say?
    Without you, it’s so hard to live.
    Can’t take much more.
    Why can’t we love like we did before.

    Forgetful heart,
    like a walking shadow in my brain.
    All night long
    I lay awake and listen to the sound of pain.
    The door has closed forever more,
    if indeed there ever was a door.
