   .      Am
Forgetful heart,

lost your power of recall.
             Dm
Every little detail
                  Am
you don’t remember at all.
             F
The times we knew,
            E7     Am
who would remember better than you?
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
Forgetful heart,
we laughed and had a good time, you and I.
It’s been so long.
Now you’re content to let the days go by.
When you were there,
you were the answer to my prayer.
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
Forgetful heart,
we loved with all the love that life can give.
What can I say?
Without you, it’s so hard to live.
Can’t take much more.
Why can’t we love like we did before.
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
Forgetful heart,
like a walking shadow in my brain.
All night long
I lay awake and listen to the sound of pain.
The door has closed forever more,
if indeed there ever was a door.
</pre>
