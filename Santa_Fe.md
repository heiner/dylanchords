    Sante Fe,
    C         D              G
    dear dear dear dear dear Sante Fe
       C                 G
    My woman needs every day
        C                  G
    She promised to let me stay
          C                    G             D
    She's rollin' up a knot to pray to gods away
             G
    She's in Sante Fe
    C         D              G
    Dear dear dear dear dear Santa Fe.
            C                    G
    Now she opens up and lets me home
          C                        G
    She's brown but she keeps from roam
           C               G
    She'll open up a happy home
           C                       D             G
    She'll think when will that be warm in Sante Fe.

    Sante Fe, dear dear dear dear Sante Fe
    She's arms never teach to roam
    They're never never far from home
    I'll never ever ever roam
    To sail away
    She's all feel bad
    No no no no don't don't don't feel bad
    She's the worst thing he's ever had
    She's a mad, man that he's so glad
    She's over above the hat to bad
    She's never disappear so bad
    I went away.

    Sante Fe, dear dear dear dear dear dear Sante Fe
    My own heart city lay
    I won't have a nature way
    And I'm leavin' every day to run away
    From Sante Fe, dear dear dear dear dear Sante Fe.
    My woman's left sittin' at home
    She's actin' the police unknown
    She cried like an evening stone
    She leap back under a broom
    But she ain't gonna find a room
    And the tears send her on own ever day.
