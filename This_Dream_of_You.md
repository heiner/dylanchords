        G
    How long can I stay

    in this nowhere cafe
                     D
    ’fore night turns into day?
             D
    I wonder why

    I’m so frightened
       G
    of dawn

    C
    All I have
        G
    and all I know
            D
    is this dream of you
                          G
    which keeps me living on

    There’s a moment when
    all old things
    become new again
    But that moment
    might have come
    and gone

    All I have
    and all I know
    is this dream of you
    which keeps me living on

            D
    I look away,
               G
    but I keep seeing it.
                    D7
    I don't wanna believe,
                 G
    but I keep believing it.
    Bm7-5   E7      Am          /g#  /g /f#
    Shadows dance upon the wall.
    A7                   D7
    Shadows that seem to know it all.

    Am I too blind to see?
    Is my heart
    playing tricks on me?
    I’m lost in the crowd,
    all my tears
    are gone.

    All I have
    and all I know
    is this dream of you
    which keeps me living on

    Everything I touch
    seems to disappear
    Everywhere I turn
    you are always here
    I run this race
    until my earthly death
    I’ll defend this place
    with my dying breath

    From a cheerless room
    in a curtained gloom
    I saw a star from heaven fall
    I turned and looked again
    but it was gone

    All I have
    and all I know
    is this dream of you
    which keeps me living on
