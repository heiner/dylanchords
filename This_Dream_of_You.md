<pre class="verse">
    G
How long can I stay

in this nowhere cafe
                 D
’fore night turns into day?
         D
I wonder why

I’m so frightened
   G
of dawn
</pre>

<pre class="refrain">
C
All I have
    G
and all I know
        D
is this dream of you
                      G
which keeps me living on
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
There’s a moment when
all old things
become new again
But that moment
might have come
and gone
</pre>

<pre class="refrain">
All I have
and all I know
is this dream of you
which keeps me living on
</pre>

<pre class="bridge2">
        D
I look away,
           G
but I keep seeing it.
                D7
I don't wanna believe,
             G
but I keep believing it.
Bm7-5   E7      Am          /g#  /g /f#
Shadows dance upon the wall.
A7                   D7
Shadows that seem to know it all.
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
Am I too blind to see?
Is my heart
playing tricks on me?
I’m lost in the crowd,
all my tears
are gone.
</pre>

<pre class="refrain">
All I have
and all I know
is this dream of you
which keeps me living on
</pre>

<pre class="bridge2">
Everything I touch
seems to disappear
Everywhere I turn
you are always here
I run this race
until my earthly death
I’ll defend this place
with my dying breath
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
From a cheerless room
in a curtained gloom
I saw a star from heaven fall
I turned and looked again
but it was gone
</pre>

<pre class="refrain">
All I have
and all I know
is this dream of you
which keeps me living on
</pre>
