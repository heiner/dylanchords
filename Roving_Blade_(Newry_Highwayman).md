             G                 F              C
    In Newry town, where I was bred and born,
    G                     F           G
    Stephen's Green now I lie in scorn.
                C                 F         C
    I served my time there to the saddlers' trade,
                 G     F      C
    And I always was a roving blade.

    At seventeen I took a wife,
    And I loved her dearer than I loved my life;
    And for to keep her both neat and gay,
    I went a-robbing on the King's highway.

    I never robbed any poor man yet,
    Nor any tradesman did I beset;*)
    But I robbed lords and their ladies fair,
    And brought their jewels to my heart's delight.

    To Covent Garden I made my way,
    With my dear wife for to see the play;
    Lord Fielding's men did me pursue,
    And taken was I by the cursed crew.

    My father cried, "My darling son."
    My wife she cried, "I am undone."
    My mother tore her white locks and cried
    that in the cradle I should have died.

    When I am dead and in my grave
    A flashy funeral pray let me have;
    Six highwaymen for to carry me.
    Give them broadswords and sweet liberty.

    Six pretty fair maids to bear my Pall,
    Give them white garlands and ribbons all.*)
    And when I'm dead they will speak the truth,
    He was a wild and a wicked youth.

\*) Dylan sings something else here

Additional fourth verse:

I robbed Lord Golding I do declare,  
And Lady Mansel, in Grosvenor Square;  
I shut the shutters and bad them good night.  
And home I went then to my heart's delight.
