The E riff is usually played in a low position at the end of every line,

Towards the end of the song, the A7 in the third line becomes less and
less pronounced, sometimes disappearing completely.

    When I send for my baby, man, and she don't come
    A7                                   E
    Send for my baby, man, and she don't come
            B7                     A7                        E
    All the doctors in Hot Springs sure ain't gonna help her none

    If she gets unruly, thinks she don't want you
    If she gets unruly and thinks she don't want you
    Take my 32-20 now and break her half in two

    She got a .38 special, but I believe it's much too light
    She got a .38 special, but I believe it's much too light
    I got a 32-30, makes the camp all right

    If I send for my baby, man, and she don't come
    Send for my baby, man, and she don't come
    All the doctors in Hot Springs sure ain't gonna help her none

    Gonna shoot my pistol, shoot my Gatling gun
    Gonna shoot my pistol, got to shoot my Gatling gun
    You made me love you, now your man has come

    Aw baby, where'd you stay last night?
    Aw baby, where'd you stay last night?
    You got your hair all tangled and you ain't talking right

    Her .38 special, boys, it do very well
    Her .38 special, boys, it do very well
    I got a 32-20 now it's a burning hell

    If I send for my baby, man, and she don't come
    Send for my baby, man, and she don't come
    All the doctors in [...] sure ain't gonna help her none

    Hey hey baby, where'd you stay last night?
    Hey hey baby, where'd you stay last night?
    Didn't come home till the sun was shining bright

    Oh boys, I just can't take my rest
    Oh boys, I just can't take my rest
    With this 32-20 laying up and down my breast
