<h4>Chords</h4>

<pre class="chords">
E       022100 alt. with 0000xx
        07999x alt. with 07777x

</pre>
The E riff is usually played in a low position at the end of every
line, and in one of the high-position forms (or simplified to simple
strumming on a single chord) while singing.

Towards the end of the song, the A7 in the third
line becomes less and less
pronounced, sometimes disappearing completely.
