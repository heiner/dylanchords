    Dm
    Come you masters of war

    You that build the big guns

    You that build the death planes
             Cadd2         Dm
    You that build all the bombs

    You that hide behind walls
             *)
    You that hide behind desks
                       Cadd2
    I just want you to know
                           Dm
    I can see through your masks

    You that never done nothin'
    But build to destroy
    You play with my world
    Like it's your little toy
    You put a gun in my hand
    And you hide from my eyes
    And you turn and run farther
    When the fast bullets fly

    Like Judas of old
    You lie and deceive
    A world war can be won
    You want me to believe
    But I see through your eyes
    And I see through your brain
    Like I see through the water
    That runs down my drain

    You fasten the triggers
    For the others to fire
    Then you set back and watch
    When the death count gets higher
    You hide in your mansion
    As young people's blood
    Flows out of their bodies
    And is buried in the mud

    You've thrown the worst fear
    That can ever be hurled
    Fear to bring children
    Into the world
    For threatening my baby
    Unborn and unnamed
                        Dm/f
    You ain't worth the blood
         Cadd2        Dm
    That runs in your veins

    How much do I know
    To talk out of turn
    You might say that I'm young
    You might say I'm unlearned
    But there's one thing I know
    Though I'm younger than you
                     Cadd2
    Even Jesus would never
       G/b           Dm
    Forgive what you do

    Let me ask you one question
    Is your money that good
    Will it buy you forgiveness
    Do you think that it could
    I think you will find
    When your death takes its toll
    All the money you made
    Will never buy back your soul

    And I hope that you die
    And your death'll come soon
    I will follow your casket
    In the pale afternoon
    And I'll watch while you're lowered
    Down to your deathbed
                             Dm/f
    And I'll stand o'er your grave
             Cadd2            Dm
    'Til I'm sure that you're dead

''No Direction Home ''version

</h2>
Basically the same as the album version, but with an intro which is
worth quoting:

I believe in the ten commandments, the first one: “I'm the Lord thy
god,” it's a great commandment if it's not said by the wrong people.

and some nice between-verses flourishes along the lines of:

      :   .   .     :   .   .     :   .   .     :   .   .     :   .   .     :   .   .
