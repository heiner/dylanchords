*Diamond Jo* was the name of a steamboat that ran on the upper
Mississippi in the period 1864-83, owned by “Diamond Jo” Reynolds. (He
also built his own railroad from Malvern to Hot Springs (Arkansas, I
believe), after a painful carriage trip to cure his rheumatism in the
healing waters of Hot Springs). The refrain line “Diamond Jo come and
get me” could be a reference to the boat.  
Early versions of the song recorded by the Georgia Crackers (1927) and
Charlie Butler (1937), then a prisoner at the Parchman prison.  
The song is not related to [Diamond Joe](/wiki/Diamond Joe "wikilink") on
[Good As I Been To You](/wiki/Good As I Been To You "wikilink"), neither
musically nor thematically.
