''Diamond Jo'' was the name of a steamboat that ran on the upper
Mississippi in the period 1864-83, owned by “Diamond Jo”
Reynolds. (He also built his own railroad from Malvern to Hot Springs
(Arkansas, I believe), after a painful carriage trip to cure his
rheumatism in the healing waters of Hot Springs). The refrain line
“Diamond Jo come and get me” could be a reference to the boat. <br>
Early versions of the song recorded by the Georgia Crackers (1927) and
Charlie Butler (1937), then a prisoner at the Parchman prison.<br>
The song is not related to [[Diamond Joe]] on [[Good As I Been To You]], neither musically nor thematically.
