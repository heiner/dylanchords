Words and music Bob Dylan  
Released on [Blood on the Tracks](Blood on the Tracks)
(1975)  
Tabbed by Eyolf Ã˜strem

[Open D/E tuning](Help:Roadmaps#Open_tunings)

The notes within parentheses in the tab below aren't really pull-offs,
they are just the audible removal of the first finger from the third
string in the chord change (which is as close to a pull-off as you can
get). The easiest way to play it is to disregard them, and just finger
the chords as indicated above the systems.  
The song can be strummed to the chords that are implied in the tab.
Since the 5th string is never played in the finger-picked version, there
is no way to decide whether an Esus4 or an A9 is implied. I've made a
suggestion, but do as you wish.

    E        054000 or 000000
    Esus4    000100
    A9       020100
    B(vii)   x00707
    A(v)     x00505
    E(iii)   004300

    Buckets of rain
    Buckets of tears
    Got all them buckets comin' out of my ears.
    Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
    I got all the love, honey baby,
    You can stand.

    [interlude]

    I been meek
    And hard like an oak
    I seen pretty people disappear like smoke.
    Friends will arrive, friends will disappear,
    If you want me, honey baby,
    I'll be here.

    [Interlude 2: replace the first line with the following:]

      E                 A9    E           E                 A9      E

    I like your smile
    And your fingertips
    I like the way that you move your lips.
    I like the cool way you look at me,
    Everything about you is bringing me
    Misery.

    [Interlude 1]

    Little red wagon
    Little red bike
    I ain't no monkey but I know what I like.
    I like the way you love me strong and slow,
    I'm takin' you with me, honey baby,
    When I go.

    [Interlude 2]

    Life is sad
    Life is a bust
    All ya can do is do what you must.
    You do what you must do and ya do it well,
    I'll do it for you, honey baby,
    Can't you tell?

    [Interlude 1 + 2]

<h2 class="songversion">
Nuggets of rain

</h2>
with Bette Midler

Some people may think this version is a disgrace. Maybe. I think it's a
quite funny disgrace.

[Aaah  
Aaaaah  
Haaa, Sing to me baby baby  
Nuggets,  
Nuggets of rain]

Nuggets of rain  
Nuggets of tears  
Got all them nuggets comin' out of my ears.  
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,  
You got all the love, honey baby,  
I can stand.

I been down  
And high like an oak  
I seen pretty people disappear like smoke.  
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear,  
If you want me, honey baby,  
I'll be here.

Like your smile  
And your fingertips  
Like the way that you move your lips.  
I like the heavenly way you look at me,  
Everything about you is bringing me  
Exstasy.

Little red wagon  
Little red bike  
I ain't no monkey but I know what I like.  
I like the way you monkey around,  
Stick with me baby, and we will  
never be found.

Life is happy  
Life is sad  
Life is a bust when you think you been had.  
You do what you must do and ya do it bad,  
I'll do it for you, honey baby,  
Ain't you glad?
