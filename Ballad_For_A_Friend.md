    Years ago we hung around,
    Watchin' trains roll through the town.
    Now that train is a-graveyard bound.

    Where we go up in that North Country,
    Lakes and streams and mines so free,
    I had no better friend than he.

    Something happened to him that day,
    I thought I heard a stranger say,
    I hung my head and stole away.

    A diesel truck was rollin' slow,
    Pullin' down a heavy load.
    It left him on a Utah road.

    They carried him back to his home town,
    His mother cried, his sister moaned,
    Listin' to them church bells tone.
