        C
    I'm ready [hallelujah]
         G
    Hallelujah [I'm ready]
          G                                D
    I can hear the voices singin' soft and low
         C
    Hallelujah [I'm ready]
        G
    I'm ready [hallelujah]
         G          D        G
    Hallelujah, I'm ready to go.

    G
    Dark was the night
          C
    Not a star was in sight
    G                           D
    On the highway headin' down below
      G
    I let my Saviour in
           C
    And He saved my soul from sin
         G          D        G
    Hallelujah, I'm ready to go.

    Hallelujah [I'm ready]
    I'm ready [hallelujah]
    I can hear the voices singin' soft and low
    I'm ready [hallelujah]
    Hallelujah [I'm ready]
    Hallelujah, I'm ready to go.

    Hallelujah [I'm ready]
    I'm ready [hallelujah]
    I can hear the voices singin' soft and low
    I'm ready [hallelujah]
    Hallelujah [I'm ready]
    Hallelujah, I'm ready to go.

    Sinner don't wait
    Before it's too late
    He's a wonderful Saviour to know.
    I fell on my knees
    He answered my pleas
    Hallelujah, I'm ready to go.

    Hallelujah [I'm ready]
    I'm ready [hallelujah]
    I can hear the voices singin' soft and low
    I'm ready [hallelujah]
    Hallelujah [I'm ready]
    Hallelujah, I'm ready to go.

    Hallelujah [I'm ready]
    I'm ready [hallelujah]
    I can hear the voices singin' soft and low
    I'm ready [hallelujah]
    Hallelujah [I'm ready]
    Hallelujah, I'm ready to go.
