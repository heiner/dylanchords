Recorded by Bob Dylan on [Bob Dylan](Bob Dylan) (1961)  
Tabbed by Eyolf Ã˜strem

* * * * *

Played in [Open D/E](Help:Roadmaps#Open_tunings) tuning. The
song is played in E, so either tune in open E or (recommended) in open D
with a capo on the 2nd fret. The basic chords are:

    E 000000
    A 020120
    B x02100

The most dominant riff that goes through the whole song, or rather:
wherever there is an E chord, is (it is mainly played on the bass
strings, but of course it doesn't matter if more strings are sounding):

      :   .   .   .     :   .   .   .
    |-0---------------|-------------------
    |-0---------------|-------------------
    |-0---------------|-------------------
    |-0---------------|-3---0-5---0-3-----
    |-0---------------|-3---0-5---0-3-----
    |-0---------------|-3---0-5---0-3-----

The verses end with a different lick:

      :   .   .   .     :
    |-----------------|--------
    |-----------------|--------
    |-----------------|--------
    |-3---0-----------|--------
    |---------3p0-----|--------
    |-------------3---|-0------

There are other riffs, but they are all mainly variations on the same
theme: open strings and strings stopped on the 3rd fret. One might even
use one's own imagination...

    E
    Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door
    A                                  E
    Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door
         B
    If I don't get the girl I'm loving
                                   E
    Won't go down to Highway 51 no more.

    Well, I know that highway like I know my hand
    Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand
    Running from up Wisconsin
    way down to no man's land.

    Well, if I should die before my time should come
    And if I should die before my time should come
    Won't you bury my body
    out on the Highway 51.

    Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door
    I said, Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door
    If I don't get the girl I'm loving
    Won't go down to Highway 51 no more.
