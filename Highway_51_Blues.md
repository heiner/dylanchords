Recorded by Bob Dylan on [[Bob Dylan]] (1961)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Ã˜strem

----
Played in [[Help:Roadmaps#Open_tunings|Open D/E]] tuning. The song is played in E, so either tune in open E or (recommended) in open D with a capo on the 2nd fret. The basic chords are:

<pre class="chords">
E 000000
A 020120
B x02100
</pre>

The most dominant riff that goes through the whole song, or rather:
wherever there is an E chord, is (it is mainly played on the bass
strings, but of course it doesn't matter if more strings are
sounding):

<pre class="tab">
  :   .   .   .     :   .   .   .
|-0---------------|-------------------
|-0---------------|-------------------
|-0---------------|-------------------
|-0---------------|-3---0-5---0-3-----
|-0---------------|-3---0-5---0-3-----
|-0---------------|-3---0-5---0-3-----
</pre>

The verses end with a different lick:

<pre class="tab">
  :   .   .   .     :
|-----------------|--------
|-----------------|--------
|-----------------|--------
|-3---0-----------|--------
|---------3p0-----|--------
|-------------3---|-0------
</pre>

There are other riffs, but they are all mainly variations on the same
theme: open strings and strings stopped on the 3rd fret. One might
even use one's own imagination...

<pre class="verse">
E
Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door
A                                  E
Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door
     B
If I don't get the girl I'm loving
                               E
Won't go down to Highway 51 no more.

Well, I know that highway like I know my hand
Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand
Running from up Wisconsin
way down to no man's land.

Well, if I should die before my time should come
And if I should die before my time should come
Won't you bury my body
out on the Highway 51.

Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door
I said, Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door
If I don't get the girl I'm loving
Won't go down to Highway 51 no more.
