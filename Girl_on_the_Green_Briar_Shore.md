                G       C      G
    Twas in the year of eighty-two
           C                 G
    In the springtime of the year
              G            C       G
    I left my mother and a home so dear
                 D                       G
    All for that girl on the green briar shore.

    My mother she says, "Son, don't go
    Don't leave me home alone
    Don't leave your mother and a home so dear
    Never trust a girl on the green briar shore."

    But I was young and reckless too
    And I craved a reckless life.
    I left my mother and a home so dear
    And I took that girl to be my wife.

    Her hair was dark and curly too
    And her lovin' eyes were blue
    Her cheeks were like the red red rose
    That girl I loved from the green briar shore.

    The years rolled on and the months rolled by
    She left me all alone.
    Now I remember what my mama said,
    "Never trust a girl on the green briar shore."
