        Am                     G
    I'm old Tom Moore from the bummer's shore
           Am       G      Am
    In the good old golden days.
                                G
    They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too
        Am         G     Am
    But what cares I for praise
      C                  Am
    I wander around from town to town
    C                   Am
     Just like a roving sign,
        C                             Am
    And all the people all say "There goes Tom Moore
           G         Am
    in the days of '49.

           F                   C
    In the days of old, in the days of gold
        F              C
    How oftentimes I repine
            F                   C
    For the days of old when we dug up the gold
           Am
    In the days of '49.

    Our comrades they all loved me well
    Jolly saucy crew
    A few hard cases I will recall
    Though they all were brave and true
    Whatever the pick, they never would flinch
    They never would fret or whine
         F                    C
    Like good old bricks,they stood the kicks
           [n.c.]    Am
    In the Days of 49

    There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy
    He was always getting tight
    And every time that he'd get full
    he was sporting for a fight
    Then Jake rampaged against a knife
    in the hands of old Bob Sign
    And over Jake they held a wake
    in the days of 49.

              Am          G
    There was Poker Bill, one of the boys
            Am              G
    Who was always in a game
    Am                 G
    Whether he lost or whether he won
       Am         G          Am
    To him it was always the same
    He would ante up and draw his cards
    And would go a hatfull blind
    In a game with death Bill lost his breath
    in the days of 49           <span class="spoken">[oh my goodness!]</span>

    There was ragshag Bill from Buffalo
    I never will forget
    He would roar all day, and he'd roar all night
    And I guess he's roaring yet
    One day he fell in a prospect hole
    In a roaring bad design
    And in that hole, he roared out his soul
    In the days of 49

    Oh the comrades all that I've had
    There's none thats left to boast
    And I'm left alone in my misery
    Like some old poor wandering ghost
    And I pass by from town to town
    They call me the ramblin' sign
    There goes Tom Moore of bummer's shore
    In the days of 49

Additional verse, not sung by Dylan:

    There was poor old Jess, the old lame cuss
    He never would relent
    Her never was known to miss a drink
    Or ever spend a cent.
    At length old Jess like all the rest
    Who never would decline,
    In all his bloom went up the flume
    In the days of '49.
