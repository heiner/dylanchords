Words by Noël Regney, music by Gloria Shayne Baker  
Released on [Christmas in the Heart](Christmas in the Heart) (2009)  
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

Tabbed in A major (original key Bb major)

The thing after the ‘Do you see …' lines is in principle something like
`A E D A/e`, but very thinly orchestrated, consisting mostly of the
figures

    A   E   D   A/e
    :   .   .   .           :   .   .   .                  :   .   .   .
    |---------5-------|     |-5---4---2---0---|            |-5---4---5---0---|
    |-----5-------5---|     |-----------------|            |-----5---7---5---|
    |-2---------------| and |-----------------|  ending    |-2------(7)------|
    |-----------------|     |-----------------|  up like:  |-----------------|
    |-----------------|     |-----------------|            |-0---------------|
    |-----------------|     |-----------------|            |-------------0---|

which is neither very playable on a single guitar, nor very interesting.
More useful is probably something like:

    A   E   D   A/e
    :   .   .   .
    |-5---4---2---0---|
    |-5---5---3---2---|
    |-6---4---2---2---|
    |-7-----------2---|
    |-7-----------0---|
    |-5-----------0---|

             A                 Em     A     Em
    Said the night wind to the little lamb:
    A                 Em   A
    Do you see what I see?
    A                  Em     A     Em
    Way up in the sky, little lamb,
    A                 Em   A
    Do you see what I see?
      F#m
    A star, a star,
    C#m
    Dancing in the night,
           D       E        C#7    F#m
    With a tail as big as a kite,
           D       E        A
    With a tail as big as a kite.

    Said the little lamb to the shepard boy:
    Do you hear what I hear?
    Ringing through the sky, shepard boy,
    Do you hear what I hear?
    A song, a song,
    High above the trees,
    With a voice as big as the sea,
    With a voice as big as the sea.

    Said the shepard boy to the mighty king:
    Do you know what I know?
    In your palace wall, mighty king,
    Do you know what I know?
    A child, a child,
    Shivers in the cold.
    Let us bring him silver and gold,
    Let us bring him silver and gold.

    Said the king to the people everywhere:
    Listen to what I say.
    Pray for peace people everywhere.
    Listen to what I say.
    The child, the child,
    Sleeping in the night,
    He will bring us goodness and light,
    He will bring us goodness and light.
