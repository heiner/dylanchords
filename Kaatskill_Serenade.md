Written by David Bromberg  
Recorded by Bob Dylan and Bromberg early/mid June 1992 (“The Bromberg
Sessions”)  
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem (thanks to Peter Vincent for lyric corrections)

One of the gems from the Bromberg sessions. The main rhythm guitar plays
the chords below, but it sounds as if there is one guitar in there
somewhere with a capo on the 4th fret, playing with C-chords. See below
for a version like that.

Peter Vincent has suggested the spelling Kaatskill, “because it was the
spelling used by Washington Irving in the story of Rip Van Winkle, on
which the song is based.” It is also the spelling that Bromberg used.
Originally, I just couldn't bring myself to writing it that way – but
I’ve changed my mind: Peter wins.

    [instr.]

                  A
    Where are the men
    B7               E
     that I used to sport with?
                 A
    What has become
    B7                  E
      of my beautiful town?

    Wolf, my own friend
    Even you don't know me
    This must be the end
    My house is tumbled down

    C#m              B    A
     My land it was rich,  but I wouldn't work it
    I guess I made a shrew of my wife
    My duty clear, I could always find some way to shirk it
    I dreamed away the best years of my life

    Seems like only this morning, I went up into the mountain
    No word of warning, just her usual curse
    I hated the house, with all her nagging and shouting
    But to be in this strange world was a thousand times worse

    Where are the men
    that I used to sport with?
    What has become
    of my beautiful town?

    Wolf, my own friend
    Even you don't know me
    This must be the end
    My house is tumbled down

    [instr.]

    He called me by name, he bought me that cheaply
    He called me by name, I didn't know what to think
    I watched their loud games, and oh, I drink deeply
    Though no-one had ever asked me to drink

    And you know that stolen liquor, it was sweeter than whiskey
    Many times quicker, just to put me to sleep
    That drinking with strangers can be very risky
    My sleep it was long, it was twenty years deep

    Where are the men
    that I used to sport with?
    What has become
    of my beautiful town?

    Wolf, my own friend
    Even you don't know me
    This must be the end
    My house is tumbled down
