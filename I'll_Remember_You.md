    C             F
    I'll remember you
    F/g                          C
     When I've forgotten all the rest,
    C              F
    You to me were true,
    F/g                 C
     You to me were the best.
               C
    When there is no more,
        C7
    You cut to the core
    F             C/e      Dm      /e  F
     Quicker than anyone I knew.
    C
     When I'm all alone
    F
     In the great unknown,
    F/g           C
    I'll remember you.

    I'll remember you
    At the end of the trail,
    I had so much left to do,
    I had so little time to fail.
    There's some people that
    You don't forget,
    Even though you've only seen 'm
    One time or two.
    When the roses fade
    And I'm in the shade
    I'll remember you.

    Bb        F               C
    Didn't I, didn't I try to love you?
    Bb        F               C
    Didn't I, didn't I try to care?
    Bb              F               C
    Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
             Dm   C/e             F       F/g
    With the rain blowing in your hair?

    I'll remember you
    When the wind blows through the piney wood.
    It was you who came right through,
    It was you who understood.
    Though I'd never say
    That I done it the way
    That you'd have liked me to.
    In the end,
    My dear sweet friend,
    I'll remember you.
