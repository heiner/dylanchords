Words and music Bob Dylan  
(from the album [New Morning](New Morning), 1970)  
Tabbed by Eyolf Ã˜strem

* * * * *

This is a piano song, and he prefers to play these on the black keys,
hence the original key is Ab major. On a guitar this suggests a capo on
the 1st fret, with the following chords:

    [shamelessly happy "la la la la"s throughout the intro:]

    G . . . |C /b Am7 . |D . C . |G . . . |
    G . . . |C .  .   . |D . . . |G . . . |

    G                     C      C/b Am
    The man in me will do nearly any task,
        D             C                              G
    And as for compensation, there's little he would ask.
           G
    Take a woman like you
           C              C/d
    To get through to the man in me.

    Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
    I think to myself I might not take it any more.
    Take a woman like your kind
    To find the man in me.

         Am                   G
    But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
            Am                G
    Just to know that you are near,
    Am                 G
    Sets my a heart a-reeling
            Am            D
    From my toes up to my ears.

    The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from bein' seen,
    But that's just because he doesn't want to turn into some machine.
    Took a woman like you
    To get through to the man in me.

    G C /b Am  D G
    La la la la etc...

    repeat and fade

    ..through

    Storms on the river of no return,
    I'd try to teach you how, but I know that you never learn.
    Take a woman like your kind
    To find the man in me.

         Bm                   A
    But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
            Bm                         A
    Just to know that you're really there,
       Bm                  A
    It sets my old heart a-reeling
    Bm               C#m        D          E
     right from my feet to the top of the stairs.

    How can you believe it? Well, I guess it's true
    I'm lying next to her, baby, but I'm thinking of you
    Take a woman like you
    To get through to the man in me.

    [instrumental verse]

    Oh, what a wonderful feeling
    Just to know that you really exist,
    It makes my, makes my head go reeling
    All you got to do is look my way, and, baby, I just can't resist

    [I] go down to the border beneath the sun
    Calling out her name, but, baby, you're the one
    Take a woman like you
    To get through to the man in me.
    Take a woman like you
    To get through to the man in me.
