               A
    Well, I've already had two beers
        D
    I'm ready for the broom
    A
    Please, Missus Henry, won't you
    D
    Take me to my room?
          A
    I'm a good ol' boy
                  E
    But I've been sniffin' too many eggs
    D
    Talkin' to too many people
                      A
    Drinkin' too many kegs

    A
    Please, Missus Henry, Missus Henry, please!
    D
    Please, Missus Henry, Missus Henry, please!
        A
    I'm down on my knees

    An' I ain't got a dime

    Well, I'm groanin' in a hallway
    Pretty soon I'll be mad
    Please, Missus Henry, won't you
    Take me to your dad?
    I can drink like a fish
    I can crawl like a snake
    I can bite like a turkey
    I can slam like a drake

    Please, Missus Henry, Missus Henry, please!
    Please, Missus Henry, Missus Henry, please!
    I'm down on my knees
    An' I ain't got a dime

    Now, don't crowd me, lady
    Or I'll fill up your shoe
    I'm a sweet bourbon daddy
    An' tonight I am blue
    I'm a thousand years old
    And I'm a generous bomb
    I'm T-boned and punctured
    But I'm known to be calm

    Please, Missus Henry, Missus Henry, please!
    Please, Missus Henry, Missus Henry, please!
    I'm down on my knees
    An' I ain't got a dime

    Now, I'm startin' to drain
    My stool's gonna squeak
    If I walk too much farther
    My crane's gonna leak
    Look, Missus Henry
    There's only so much I can do
    Why don't you look my way
    An' pump me a few?

    Please, Missus Henry, Missus Henry, please!
    Please, Missus Henry, Missus Henry, please!
    I'm down on my knees
    An' I ain't got a dime
