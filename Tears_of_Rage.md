some points.

    G

       G                  Em
    We carried you in our arms
       C            Am
    On Independence Day,
        F                  C
    And now you'd throw us all aside
        G
    And put us on our way.
       G                             Em
    Oh what dear daughter 'neath the sun
          C              Am
    Would treat a father so,
       F             C
    To wait upon him hand and foot
        G
    Yet always answer "No"?

    B              Em
    Tears of rage, tears of grief,
    C                                G
    Why am I always the one who must be the thief?
    B
    Come to me now, you know
          Em        /d
    We're so alone
    C   Am      G         C/g G
    And life is brief.

    We pointed out the way to go
    And scratched your name in sand,
    Though you just thought that it was nothing more
    Than a place for you to stand.
    Now, I want you to know that while you watched,
    discovered that there was no one true,
    that I myself really thought
    It was just a childish thing to do.

    Tears of rage, tears of grief,
    Why am I always the one who must be the thief?
    Come to me now, you know
    We're so alone
    And life is brief.

    It was all very very painless
    When you ran out to receive
    All that false instruction
    Which we never could believe.
    And now the heart is filled with gold
    As if it was a purse.
    But, oh, what kind of love is this
    Which goes from bad to worse?

    Tears of rage, tears of grief,
    Why am I always the one who must be the thief?
    Come to me now, you know
    We're so alone
    And life is brief.
