C
One more night, the stars are in sight
                   F        G      C
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be.
        F       G       C
Oh, the moon is shinin' bright,
         F    G        G7
Lighting ev'rything in sight,
    C          F          G        C
But tonight no light will shine on me.

Oh, it's shameful and it's sad, I lost the only pal I had,
I just could not be what she wanted me to be.
I will turn my head up high
To that dark and rolling sky,
For tonight no light will shine on me.

G           F            C                     Dm
I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true,
C        Em          F                   G
I had no idea what a woman in love would do!
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
One more night, I will wait for the light
While the wind blows high above the tree.
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
But tonight no light will shine on me.
</pre>

[instrumental break]

<pre class="verse">
One more night, the moon is shinin' bright
And the wind blows high above the tree.
Oh, I miss that woman so,
I didn't mean to see her go,
But tonight no light will shine on me.</pre>
