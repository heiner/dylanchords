    One more night, the stars are in sight
                       F        G      C
    But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be.
            F       G       C
    Oh, the moon is shinin' bright,
             F    G        G7
    Lighting ev'rything in sight,
        C          F          G        C
    But tonight no light will shine on me.

    Oh, it's shameful and it's sad, I lost the only pal I had,
    I just could not be what she wanted me to be.
    I will turn my head up high
    To that dark and rolling sky,
    For tonight no light will shine on me.

    G           F            C                     Dm
    I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true,
    C        Em          F                   G
    I had no idea what a woman in love would do!

    One more night, I will wait for the light
    While the wind blows high above the tree.
    Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
    But tonight no light will shine on me.

    [instrumental break]

    One more night, the moon is shinin' bright
    And the wind blows high above the tree.
    Oh, I miss that woman so,
    I didn't mean to see her go,
    But tonight no light will shine on me.
