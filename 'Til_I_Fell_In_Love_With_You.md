Words and music by Bob Dylan
Released on [Time out of Mind](Time out of Mind) (1997)
Tabbed by Eyolf Ã˜strem

Standard three-chord blues, with more of a E feeling than G, so
therefore: Capo 6th fret (Original key B flat major)

    E
    Well my nerves are exploding

    And my body is tense

    I feel like the whole world

    got me pinned up against the fence
                   A
    I been hit too hard

    Seen too much
                E
    Nothing can heal me now

    But your touch
    B
    I just don't know what I'm gonna do
          A               E
    I was allright 'til I fell in love with you

    Well my house is on fire
    Burnin' to the sky
    Well I thought it would rain
    But the clouds passed by
    I feel like I'm comin'
    To the end of my way
    But I know God is my shield
    And he won't lead me astray
    Still I don't know what I'm gonna do
    I was allright 'til I fell in love with you

    Boys in the street
    Beginnin' to play
    Girls like birds
    Flyin' away
    When I'm gone
    You will remember my name
    I'm gonna win my way
    To wealth and fame
    Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do
    I was allright 'til I fell in love with you

    Well junk's pilin' up
    Takin' up space
    My eyes feel
    Like they're fallin' off my face
    Sweat fallin' down
    I'm starin' at the floor
    I'm thinkin' about that girl
    Who won't be back no more
    I just don't know what to do
    I was allright 'til I fell in love with you

    Well I'm tired of talkin'
    I'm tired of tryin' to explain
    My attempts to please you
    They were all in vain
    Tomorrow night
    Before the sun goes down
    If I'm still among the livin'
    I'll be Dixie bound
    Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do
    I was allright 'til I fell in love with you
