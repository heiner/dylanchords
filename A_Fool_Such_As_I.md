            G               D            G
    Now an' then, there's a fool such as I.

           G              B7      C               G
    Pardon me if I'm sentimental, when we say goodbye
             G               E                       A        D7-10
    Don't be angry, don't be angry with me, should I cry
                G           B7             C                 G
    When you're gone I will dream a little dream as years go by
                            D                    G
    Now an' then, there's a fool, a fool such as I

            C                           G
    Now an' then there's a fool such as I am over you
        A
    You taught me how to love an' now
    D                       D+
    you say that we are through
           G           B7
    I am a fool, but I love you dear, yes I will,
      C                  G
    until the day I die
                           D            G
    Now an' then there's a fool such as I

    Pardon me, pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye
    Don't be angry, don't be angry with me, should I cry
    When you're gone, when you're gone, I will dream a little,
    I will dream as years go by
    Now an' then, now an' then, there's a fool, a fool such as I.

    Now an' then there's a fool, a fool such as I am over you
    You taught me how to love an' now
    you say that we are through
    I am a fool, yes but I love you dear,
    I will love you dear, until the day, until the day I die
    Now an' then, now an' then there's a fool, a fool such as I
    Now an' then, there's a fool, a fool such as I.

            G               D
    Now an' then, there's a fool
            C7    G
    such as I.

    I am a fool, but I love you dear, until the day I die
    Now an' then there's a fool such as I.
