    [fever]   in the morning

    fever all through the night

    Captain Smith and Pocahontas
    had a very mad affair
    When he put his arms all around her
    she said, "I get a fever that's so hard to bear"

    You give me fever
    When you kiss me
    fever when you hold me tight
    [fever] in the morning
    fever all through the night

    Sun lights up the daytime,
    moon lights up the night
    I light up when you call my name,
    cause I know you gonna treat me right

    You give me fever
    When you kiss me
    fever when you hold me tight
    [fever] in the morning
    fever all through the night
