<pre class="verse">
Captain Smith and Pocahontas
had a very mad affair
When he put his arms all around her
she said, "I get a fever that's so hard to bear"
</pre>

<pre class="refrain">
You give me fever
When you kiss me
fever when you hold me tight
[fever] in the morning
fever all through the night
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
Sun lights up the daytime,
moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name,
cause I know you gonna treat me right
</pre>

<pre class="refrain">
You give me fever
When you kiss me
fever when you hold me tight
[fever] in the morning
fever all through the night
</pre>
