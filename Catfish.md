    Lazy stadium night

    Catfish on the mound

    "Strike three”, the umpire said

    Batter has to go back an' sit down.

    Catfish, million dollar man

    Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.

    But the old man wouldn't pay                    |-6---6-5---6--------------
    So he packed his glove and took his arm         |-7---7-6---7--------------
    An' one day he just ran away.                   |--------------------------

    Come up where the yankees are
    Dress up in a pin-stripe suit
    Smoke a custom-made cigar
    Wear an alligator boot.
    Catfish, million dollar man
    Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.
