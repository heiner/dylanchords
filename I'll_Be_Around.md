        C                F            C
    I'm glad I've got to see you once again
                   G                     C
    although we're through, I still love you
      C               F               C
    I guess I have to call you just a friend
            G                    C
    Someone new has just stepped in

      G                                 C
    I try to tell my heart that I don't need you
    G                            C
    But I know that it is just a lie
        C              F                   C
    And if someday his love should prove untrue
             G                          C
    I'll be around when he has said goodbye.
