Verses not sung by Dylan

</h3>
    Christ, by highest heaven adored;
    Christ, the everlasting Lord;
    Late in time behold him come,
    Offspring of the Virgin's womb.
    Veiled in flesh the Godhead see;
    Hail the incarnate Deity,
    Pleased as man with man to dwell;
    Jesus, our Emmanuel.

    Hark the herald angels sing
    Glory to the newborn King.

    Mild he lays his glory by,
    Born that man no more may die,
    Born to raise the sons of earth,
    Born to give them second birth.
    Risen with healing in his wings,
    Light and life to all he brings,
    Hail, the Sun of Righteousness
    Hail, the heaven-born Prince of Peace.

    Hark the herald angels sing
    Glory to the newborn King.

    Come, Desire of nations come,
    Fix in us Thy humble home;
    Rise, the Woman's conquering Seed,
    Bruise in us the Serpent's head.
    Adam's likeness now efface:
    Stamp Thine image in its place;
    Second Adam, from above,
    Reinstate us in thy love.

    Hark the herald angels sing
    Glory to the newborn King.
