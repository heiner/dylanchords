    D        A  D

                   D
    Go 'way little boy
    A           D
    I'm not for you
    D  Bm      G
    Go back to her
          D         Bm     G
    Where you'll be more secure
    D                  C             Bm
    She knows you much better than I do
                   D
    Go 'way little boy
    A           D
    I'm not for you

    Go 'way little boy
    You're making me sad
    I don't wanna see you bleed
    She's the one that you need
    You'll never miss what you ain't never had
    Go 'way little boy
    You're making me sad
    Go way little boy
    It's much too late
    Walk back out the door
    Dont wanna see you no more
    You're making it hard for me to concentrate
    Go 'way little boy
    It's much too late

    Bm        /a#       /a   /g#
    Can't you hear your mama callin'
              G    A        D
    Don't you recognize her voice
      Bm          /a#    /a       /g#
    I think you'd better heed her warning
          G                  Em
    While you still have the choice

    Go way little boy
    You're much too late
    Your future's bright
    Dont throw it away tonight
    It's getting hard for me to look you in the eye
    Go 'way little boy
    you're makin' me cry
