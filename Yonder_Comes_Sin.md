Written by Bob Dylan  
Recorded in the Rundown studios, October 1980 ([Shot of
Love](Shot of Love) sessions)  
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

Great song! “You've been seeking them eternal, spiritual things, / but
your fifty-dollar smile confirms / You're still tryin' to buy your way
into the dreams of them / Whose bodies will be food for worms.” The
born-again equivalent of “You might think he loves you for your money,
but I know what he really loves you for: It's your brand new
leopard-skin pill-box hat” . . .

Whereas the full band sound of the second last line of the verses is as
indicated below (with a G at “grind”) one guitar – possibly Dylan's –
plays a D throughout the line.

The only known sounding version of the song ends after verse four. The
rest of the verses exist only in copyright documents. The copyrighted
version also has different punchlines in each of the verses (“can't you
take it on the chin”, “Pour me another glass of gin”, “Ain't no room
tonight at the inn”, “Sounding like a sweet violin”)

    A
    You wanna talk to me,
           C          G       A
    you got many things to say
    A
    You want the spirit to be speaking through,
            C                G           A
    but your lust for comfort get in the way
          A
    I can read it in your eyes, oh, what your
    C          G         A
    Heart will not reveal
             A                        C
    And that old evil burden has been draggin' you down,
             G                    D     (Dsus4-D)
    bound to grind you 'neath the wheel
    /d /c  /a    A
    Yonder comes sin.

    A
    (Walkin' like a man, talkin' like an angel)
    D  /c  /a    A
    Yonder comes sin.
    A
    (Proud like a peacock, swift like an eagle)
    D
    Look at your feet, see where they've been to

    Look at your hands, see what they been into
    E
    Can't you take it on the chin?
    D  /c  /a    A
    Yonder comes sin.

    You see this woman standin' next to me
    She's foreign to your sight
    Well, her eyes may be a different colour than mine,
    but her blood is red and her bones are white.
    You've been seeking them eternal, spiritual things,
    but your fifty-dollar smile confirms
    You're still tryin' to buy your way into the dreams of them
    Whose bodies will be food for worms
    Yonder comes sin

    (Ready and steady, willing and able)
    Yonder comes sin
    (Standin' on the chair, standin' on the table)
    Look at your feet, see where they've been to
    Look at your hands, see what they've been into
    Can't you take it on the chin?
    Yonder comes sin.

    I say: See them six wild horses, honey
    You say: I don't even see one.
    You say: Point them out to me, love,
    I say: Honey I got to run
    My brother's blood is crying from the grave
    but you can't hear the voice
    I stand in jeopardy every hour,
    Wonderin' what reason you have to rejoice.
    Yonder comes sin.

    (Down on your knees, down into the ditches)
    Yonder comes sin.
    (Vomiting up jewels, vomiting up riches)
    Look at your feet see where they've been to
    Look at your hands, see what they've been into
    Enough to put you to tail-spin
    Yonder comes sin.

    Jeremiah preached repentance
    To those that would turn from hell
    But the critics all gave him such bad reviews
    Put him down at the bottom of a well
    kept on talking, anyway
    As the people were put into chains
    Wasn't nobody there to say "Bon voyage"
    or shatter any bottles of champagne.
    Yonder comes sin

    (Cracking that whip, just like a feather)
    Yonder comes sin
    (Put a knife in your back while talking about the weather)
    Look at your feet see where they've been to
    Look at your hands, see what they've been into
    Can you take it on the chin
    Yonder comes sin

    High cost of survival
    Gets a little higher than you expect
    When you're trying to get along with your enemies
    And still maintain your self-respect
    As a child you knew all there was to know
    It just couldn't get expressed
    Now it scares me to see what you accept as good
    At one you wouldn't have settled forless than the best
    Yonder comes sin

    (Way down deep and dirty, not a day under thirty)
    Yonder comes sin
    (Tasting like peaches, hanging on like leaches)
    Look at your feet see where they've been to
    Look at your hands, see what they've been into
    So masculine, so feminine
    Yonder comes sin

    You turn your back on the hard truth
    Just to fatten up your purse
    Sings of an unrighteous world
    Dare the same thing as a curse
    No kingdom made of human hands can stand
    Too bad about MacBeth
    In order to possess that corruptible crown
    Gotta make a deal with Mr Death
    Yonder comes sin.

    (Can you comprehend it, can you understand it)
    Yonder comes sin
    (It rules the airways, it rules the planet)
    Look at your feet see where they've been to
    Look at your hands, see what they've been into
    Take off that sheepish green
    Yonder comes sin

    There's a place down in your soul
    Where the law can never touch
    You do most likely what you please
    And not think about too much
    I'll be down the line when morning comes
    And that I pulled the hood up for you
    So that you could see real good your uninvited guest
    Yonder comes sin

    (It's a pleasure to meet ya, nice to have known ya)
    Yonder comes sin
    (It wants to kill you, it wants to own you)
    Look at your feet see where they've been to
    Look at your hands, see what they've been into
    Being pulled in all directions by the wind
    Yonder comes sin
