    B
    Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee

    They're throwing knives into the tree

    Two big bags of dead man's bones

    Got their noses to the grindstone
    E
    Living in the Land of Nod
    B
    Trusting their fate to the hands of God
    E
    They pass by so silently
    B
    Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee

    Well, they're going to the country, they're going to retire
    They're taking a streetcar named Desire
    Looking at a window with a pecan pie
    Lot of things they'd like they would never buy
    Neither one want to turn and run
    And making a voyage to the sun.
    "His master's voice is calling me,"
    Said Tweedle Dum to Tweedle Dee.

    Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum
    All that and more and then some
    They walk among the stately trees
    They know the secrets of the breeze
    Tweedle Dum said to Tweedle Dee,
    "Your presence is obnoxious to me,
    Feel like baby sitting on a woman's knee."
    Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee

    Well, the rain beatin' down on a window pane
    I got love for you, and it's all in vain
    Brains in a pot, they're beginning to boil
    They're dripping with garlic and olive oil.
    Tweedle Dee is on his hands and his knees,
    Saying, "Throw me something, Mister, please!"
    "What's good for you is good for me,"
    Said Tweedle Dum to Tweedle Dee.

    Well, they're living in a happy harmony
    Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee
    They're one day older and a dollar short
    They got a parade permit and a police escort
    They're lying low and they're making hay
    They seem determined to go all the way
    They run a brick and tile company
    Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee

    Well, a childish dream is a deathless need
    And a noble truth is a sacred creed.
    My pretty baby, she's looking around.
    She's wearing a multi-thousand dollar gown.
    Tweedle Dee is a low-down sorry old man.
    Tweedle Dum, he'll stab you where you stand.
    "I've had too much of your company,"
    Said Tweedle Dum to Tweedle Dee.

Kenneth Mirandola comments that in live versions (fall 2001) “Larry
played in A capoed on the second fret for a sounding key of B major.
Sexton played uncapoed. So I think Larry played the intro riff....and
Sexton played the riff between the verses the end of lines 5 and 7
verses.”

Patrik Winquist confirms this, that “Larry played the opening riff in
Stockholm with a capo on the 2nd fret”. So that would be:

      B
      :   .   .   .     :   .   .   .        :   .   .   .     :   .   .   .
