           C              Dm7/f C
    Well I ain't a-got my child-hood
       C         Dm7  /f  C
    Or friends I once did know
         C              Dm7  C
    No I ain't a-got my childhood
       C         Dm7      C
    Or friends I once did know
        C(iii)         F(v)  C(iii)
    But I still got my voice left
          F(v)       Dm7   G C
    I can take it anywhere I go
    Dm7          G     /e-/f     C    Dm7 G
    Hey hey so I guess I'm doin' fine.

    An I've never had much money
    But I'm still around somehow
    No I've never had much money
    But I'm still around somehow
    Many times I've bended
    But I ain't never yet bowed
    Hey hey so I guess I'm doin' fine.

    Trouble oh trouble
    I've trouble on my mind
    Trouble oh trouble
    Trouble on my mind
    But the trouble in the world, Lord
    Is much more bigger than mine
    Hey hey so I guess I'm doin' fine.

    An' I never had no armies
    To jump at my command
    No I ain't a-got no armies
    To jump at my command
    But I don't need no armies
    I got me one good friend
    Hey hey so I guess I'm doin' fine.

          C                       Dm7
    I been kicked an' whipped an' trampled on
           C       Dm7       C   Dm7 G
    I been shot at just like you
           C                      Dm7      C
    I been kicked an' whipped an' trampled on
           Dm7     G         C
    I been shot at just like you
    But as long as the world keeps turnin'
    I just keep turnin' too
    Hey hey so I guess I'm doin' fine.

    Well my road might be rocky
    The stones might cut my face
    My road might be rocky
    The stones might cut my face
    But there's some folks ain't got no road at all
    They gotta stand in the same old place
    Hey hey so I guess I'm doin' fine.
