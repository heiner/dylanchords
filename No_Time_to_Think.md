Words and music Bob Dylan  
Released on [Street Legal](Street Legal) (1978)  
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

Capo 1st fret (Original key Bb major)

The “E/a” chord (x02100) might as well be a mistake by someone in the
muddy “Street Legal” sound – but it sounds good...

* * * * *

       D               A           E           A
    In death, you face life with a child and a wife
        E/a                      A           D        E
    Who sleep-walks through your dreams into walls.
             D          A             E            A
    You're a soldier of mercy, you're cold and you curse,
            E         A            D        E
    "He who cannot be trusted must fall."

    D/a   A     A/e   E          D/a   A  A/e    E
    Loneliness, tenderness, high society, notoriety.
        D             A              E      A
    You fight for the throne and you travel alone
       D                   E
    Unknown as you slowly sink
                           A       Asus4    A
    And there's no time to think.

    In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity,
    In secret, for pieces of change. -
    The empress attracts you but oppression distracts you
    And it makes you feel violent and strange.

    Memory, ecstasy, tyranny, hypocrisy
    Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss
    In the valley of the missing link
    And you have no time to think.

    Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you
    Her worst is better than best.
    I've seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes
    And I feel so depressed.

    China doll, alcohol, duality, mortality.
    Mercury rules you and destiny fools you
    Like the plague, with a dangerous wink
    And there's no time to think.

    Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you
    Where the lion lies down with the lamb.
    I'd have paid off the traitor and killed him much later
    But that's just the way that I am.

    Paradise, sacrifice, mortality, reality.
    But the magician is quicker and his game
    Is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
    And there's no time to think.

    Anger and jealousy's all that he sells us,
    when 're under his thumb.
    Madmen oppose him but your kindness throws him
    To survive if you play deaf and dumb.

    Equality, liberty, humility, simplicity.
    You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear
    At the back of your head as you drink
    And there's no time to think.

    Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow
    Will offer their heads for a prayer.
    You can't find no salvation, you have no expectations
    Anytime, anyplace, anywhere.

    Mercury, gravity, nobility, humility.
    You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper
    That is leading you onto the brink
    But there's no time to think.

    You've murdered your vanity, buried your sanity
    For pleasure you must now resist.
    Lovers obey you but they cannot sway you
    They're not even sure you exist.

    Socialism, hypnotism, patriotism, materialism.
    Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws
    And the sound of the keys as they clink
    But there's no time to think.

    The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl
    With the rose in her hair.
    Starlight in the East and you're finally released
    You're stranded but with nothing to share.

    Loyalty, unity, epitome, rigidity.
    You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille
    'Neath the moon shinin' bloody and pink
    And there's no time to think.

    Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you
    But no, you will not be deceived.
    Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt,
    You can give but you cannot receive.

    No time to choose when the truth must die,
    No time to lose or say goodbye,
    No time to prepare for the victim that's there,
    No time to suffer or blink
    And no time to think.
