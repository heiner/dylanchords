           C
    Oh the summertime is coming
            F                  C
    And the leaves are sweetly blooming
            F             C
    And the wild mountain thyme
            Dm               F
    Blooms around the purple heather.
             C   F      C
    Will you go, lassie, go.

    If my true love she won't go,
    I will surely find another
    To pull wild mountain thyme
    From all around the purple heather.
    Will you go, lassie, go.

              F        C
    And we'll all go together
            F             C
    To pull wild mountain thyme
              Dm               F
    From all around the purple heather.
             C   F      C
    Will you go, lassie, go.

    I will build my love a tower   *)
    At the foot of yonder mountain  *)
    And then on it I will put
    All the flowers of the mountain
    Will you go, lassie, go.

    And we'll all go together
    To pull wild mountain thyme
    From all around the purple heather.
    Will you go, lassie, go.

\*) Several other versions have “bower” and “fountain” here, but this
seems to be what they sing.
