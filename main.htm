<span class="date">Dec 10:</span>
CitH is fairly complete now. As an
experiment, I&rsquo;ve placed the chord charts in a fixed box to the
right, so that they are visible all the time. <a href="mail.htm">Let me
    know</a> what you think about it: is it of any help, or just annoying?<br />
I&rsquo;ve fixed the stylsheet for printing so that the chordbox is
printed in the ordinary location. </p>

<p><span class="date">Dec 7:</span> It&rsquo;s soon
Christmas, and I&rsquo;ve
started making <a href="48_cith/index.html">my Christmas gifts</a>. I
haven&rsquo;t proofread them yet, so consider them as sneak-peeks. If you
spot errors, please </p>
<a><span class="date">Sept 17:</span> <a
href="47_ttl/index.html">Done &hellip;</a></p>

<p><span class="date">June 8:</span> I know I shouldn't do this while I still
have songs left on TTL, but a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do, and I had
to do it: There are some hauntingly beautiful songs on Johnny Cash's latest
(it's too early to say "last" yet &ndash; he may be dead, but he&rsquo;s not
gone), <em>American Recordings V: A Hundred Highways</em> (2006), such as <a
href="others/cash_if-you-could.html">If You Could Read My Mind</a> and
<a href="others/cash_loves-been-good-to-me.html">Love&rsquo;s Been Good to
Me</a>.

<p><span class="date">May 29:</span>
    As some of you may have noticed, I've started working on the songs
    from <em>Together Through Life</em>. Additionally, I started cleaning
    up my request list, so here are two old gems: <a
    href="00_misc/ballad-of-the-gliding-swan.html">Ballad of the Gliding
Swan</a> from <em>Madhouse on Castle Street</em> (1962) and <a
href="00_misc/remember_me_when_the_candle_lights.html">Remember me (When
the Candle Lights are Gleaming).</a></p>

    <p><span class="date">March 28:</span> For the Norwegians out there: I
    always wanted to play Lillebj&oslash;rn Nilsen's <a
href="others/lillebjorn_stilleste-gutt.html">Stilleste Gutt P&aring;
Sovesal En</a>, since my cousins, who were a few years older than me and
cool (hi, Hallvard! Hi, Birgit!), could play it. Now I can too (and so can
my youngest son &ndash; hi, Bendik!).  </p>

    <p><span class="date">March 19, 2009:</span> Updated <a
        href="36_wgw/lovehenry.htm" name="Love Henry">Love Henry</a>, <a
    href="36_wgw/world_gone_wrong.htm">World Gone Wrong</a> and some of
the other songs on that album with more complete tabs. There is also a
brand new <a href="36_wgw/index.htm">Introductory note to World Gone
Wrong</a>.</p>

<!--    <p>I don't usually do this, but if someone has a decent-to-good video
clip in digital form (a) of the grammy acceptance speech in 1991 and (b) of one
of the sermons from the gospel tours, preferably one of the intros to Solid
Rock, I'd be more than happy if you'd <a href="mail.htm">drop me a note</a>.
</p>-->
    <p><strong>Reminder #1:</strong> There's more to this site than just
    the chords. Check out the <em><a
    href="professors/index.htm">professors</a></em> section, with the
    articles about Dylan and his music. Most of it is collected and nicely
    typeset (if I may say so) in a <a href="tt.pdf" name="Things Twice
    [pdf, 2 Mb]">pdf book</a>, but I have also prepared <em><a
    href="professors/index.htm">html versions</a></em> of the individual
    articles. <br />I can recommend the chapters about <a
    href="http://dylanchords.info/professors/tt/ttch13.html">the guitar
    playing on Don't Think Twice</a>, about the <a
    href="professors/tt/ttch6.html">&ldquo;mathematical music&rdquo; in
    <em>Chronicles</em></a>, and the discussion about <a
    href="professors/tt/ttpa4.html">plagiarism on <em>Modern
    Times</em></a> and the previous albums. And if you still have  time,
    or want a general overview over Dylan's musical carreer, that's what
    <a href="professors/tt/ttch11.html">The Uneven Heart</a> is meant to
    give.</p>
    <p><strong>Reminder #2:</strong> There's also the <a
        href="http://oestrem.com/thingstwice/index.php">blog</a>, with my
    <a href="http://oestrem.com/thingstwice/2009/02/cant-wait/"
    name="Can't Wait">Last words on &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t Wait&rdquo;</a>,
and, ehem, a brilliant new piece about <a
href="http://oestrem.com/thingstwice/2009/02/confessions-of-a-class-traitor/">a
cursed class traitor</a> &hellip;</p> <p>I welcome <a
href="mail.htm">comments</a>.</p>
    <p><span class="date">Feb 8 2009:</span> Some more <a
        href="46_bs8/index.htm"> Tell Tale</a> tabs: <a
    href="41_lat/mississippi.htm" name="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>, <a
href="38_toom/cantwait.htm">Can&rsquo;t wait</a> in two versions that are
musically quite different yet almost the same, and lyrically far superior
to the version on <a href="38_toom/index.htm">Time Out Of Mind</a>.</p>
<p><span class="date">Oct 12:</span> Finally some action. First of
    all, I got rid of that extra menu that used to be here to the right,
    which wasn't just ugly, it was also a disaster from a usability point
    of view. I was in the middle of some experimenting back when I decided
    to close down a couple of years ago, and when the site resurfaced,
    there was nobody there to clean up the mess.<br />That done, I did
    some tabbing. Slow and steady, a couple of tabs a day, no frenzy. <a
    href="46_bs8/index.htm">Tell Tale Signs</a>.</p> <p><span
class="date">Oct 7:</span> Yeah, I know, there&rsquo;s a new album out but
where are the chords? Sorry, folks, I've been too busy to have the all the
chords ready for ya on release day  this time around. I promise you,
though, they will all be here, eventually. Quite soon too. Quite a good
album too.</p>
    <p><span class="date">June 14:</span> The <a href="chordszip.htm">zip
        file</a> has been updated, and so has <a
    href="http://www.math.tu-dresden.de/~kuettler/seal/">Seal</a>, which
should now work well even on Windows.</p>

<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 80%; width: 85%; margin: 1em

    looking at is an unofficial mirror of Eyolf &Oslash;strem's <a

is temporarily unavailable due to the American Music Publishers'
Association (MPA)'s "rattling of sabres against tab sites". Thankfully <a

recent copy of the site, which I have uploaded as a service to fellow
guitar-playing Dylan fans who may be experiencing withdrawal symptoms.</p>
