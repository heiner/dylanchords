Written by Bob Dylan and Helena Springs  
Recorded during the [Street Legal](Street Legal "wikilink") sessions
(Apr 1978)  
Tabbed by Eyolf Ã˜strem

Played with Dylan at the piano, hence in C\# major. I'd suggest a capo
on the 1st fret if you play it on the guitar.  
There are some changes in the lyrics compared to the copyrighted lyrics.

    F       G             C  Am
    We have got to come together
    F        G           C
    How long can we stay apart?
    F       G            C  Am
    You may get it maybe never
             F      G        C
    But it's coming from the heart.

    Your mind is filled with indecision
    You can't make up your mind.
    We must get it in position
    And move it on down the line.

    Make me up a bed of roses
    hang it down on the vine
    Of all my loves you've been the closest
    That's ever been on my mind.

                    C                      F
    And the road is long, it's a long hard climb
                   G                      C
    I been on that road for too long of a time
                    C                      F
    Yes the road is long, and it winds and winds
                        G                  C
    When I think of the love that I left behind.

    Don't talk to me about tomorrow
    I really don't care
    This home is filled with too much sorrow
    That nobody's heart should bear.

    And the road is long, it's a long hard climb
    I been on that road for too long of a time
    Yes the road is long, and it winds and winds
    When I think of the love that I left behind.

    Another man has hurt you honey,
    why must I pay for that part?
    Our love can't be bought with money
    'Cause it's coming from the heart.

    And the road is long, it's a long hard climb
    I been on that road for too long of a time
    Yes the road is long, and it winds and winds
    When I think of the love that I left behind.

Additional verse in the copyrighted lyrics:

    Please, please give me indication
    Stop and talk to me
    Like a river that is flowing
    My love will never cease to be.
