<pre class="verse">
G
The pale moon rose in its glory
C
Out o'er the western town
C               G
She told a sad, sad story
D                    G
Of the great ship that went down.
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
T'was the fourteenth day of April
Over the way she rolled
Sailing into tomorrow
To a golden age foretold
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
The night was bright with starlight
The seas were sharp and clear
Moving through the shadows
The promised hour was near
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
Lights were holding steady
Gliding over the foam
All the lords and ladies
Heading for their eternal home
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
The chandeliers were swaying
From the balustrades above
The orchestra was playing
The songs of faded love
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
The watchman, he lay dreaming
As the ballroom dancers twirled
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
Into the underworld
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
Leo took his sketchbook
He was often so inclined
He closed his eyes and painted
The scenery in his mind
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
Cupid struck his bosom
And broke it with a snap
The closest woman to him
He fell into her lap
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
He heard a loud commotion
Something sounded wrong
His inner spirit was saying
That he couldn't stand here long
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
He staggered to the quarterdeck
No time now to sleep
Water on the quarterdeck
Already three foot deep
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
Smokestack was leaning sideways
Heavy feet began to pound
He walked into the whirlwind
The sky splitting all around
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
The ship was going under
The universe had opened wide
The roll was called up yonder
The angels turned aside
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
Lights down in the hallway
Flickering dim and dull
Dead bodies already floating
In the double bottom hull
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
The engines then exploded
Propellers they failed to start
The boilers overloaded
The ship's bow split apart
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
Passengers were flying
Backward, forward, far and fast
They mumbled, fumbled, and tumbled
Each one more weary than the last
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
The veil was torn asunder
'Tween the hours of twelve and one
No change, no sudden wonder
Could undo what had been done
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
The watchman lay there dreaming
At forty-five degrees
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
Dropping to her knees
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
Wellington he was sleeping
His bed began to slide
His valiant heart was beating
He pushed the tables aside
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
Glass of shattered crystal
Lay scattered roundabout
He strapped on both his pistols
How long could he hold out?
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
His men and his companions
Were nowhere to be seen
In silence there he waited for
Time and space to intervene
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
The passageway was narrow
There was blackness in the air
He saw every kind of sorrow
Heard voices everywhere
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
Alarm bells were ringing
To hold back the swelling tide
Friends and lovers clinging
To each other side by side
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
Mothers and their daughters
Descending down the stairs
Jumped into the icy waters
Love and pity sent their prayers
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
The rich man, Mister Astor
Kissed his darling wife
He had no way of knowing
be the last trip of his life
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
Calvin, Blake, and Wilson
Gambled in the dark
Not one of them would ever live to
Tell the tale of the disembark
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
Brother rose up 'gainst brother
In every circumstance
They fought and slaughtered each other
In a deadly dance.
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
They lowered down the lifeboats
From the sinking wreck
There were traitors, there were turncoats
Broken backs and broken necks
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
The bishop left his cabin
To help all those in need
Turned his eyes up to the heavens
Said: "the poor are yours to feed"
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
Davey the brothel-keeper
Came out, dismissed his girls
Saw the water getting deeper
Saw the changing of his world
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
Jim Dandy smiled
He'd never learned to swim
Saw the little crippled child
And he gave his seat to him
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
He saw the starlight shining
Streaming from the east
Death was on the rampage
But his heart was now at peace
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
They battened down the hatches
But the hatches wouldn't hold
They drowned upon the staircase
Of brass and polished gold
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
Leo said to Cleo:
"I think I'm going mad"
But he'd lost his mind already
Whatever mind he'd had
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
He tried to block the doorway
To save others from harm
Blood from that open wound
Pouring down his arm.
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
Petals fell from flowers
'Til all of them were gone
In the long and dreadful hours
The wizard's curse played on
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
The host was pouring brandy
He was going down slow
He stayed right 'til the end,
he was the last to go
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
There were many, many others
Nameless here forevermore
They never sailed the ocean
Or left their homes before
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
The watchman he lay dreaming
The damage had been done
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
And he tried to tell someone
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
The Captain, barely breathing
Kneeling at the wheel
Above him and beneath him
Fifty thousand tons of steel
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
He looked over at his compass
And he gazed into its face
Needle pointing downward
He knew he'd lost the race
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
In the dark illumination
He remembered bygone years
He read the Book of Revelation
And he filled his cup with tears
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
When the Reaper's task had ended
Sixteen hundred had gone to rest
The good, the bad, the rich, the poor
The loveliest and the best
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
They waited at the landing
And they tried to understand
But there is no understanding
For the judgement of God's hand
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
News came o'er the wires
And struck with deadly force
Love had lost its fires
All things had run their course
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
The watchman he lay dreaming
Of all things that can be
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
Into the deep blue sea
</pre>
