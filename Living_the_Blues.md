C
Since you've been gone,
          F
I've been walking around
        C            G          C
With my head bowed down to my shoes.
                     G7
I've been living the blues
                    C
Ev'ry night without you.

G  /g /a /b

I don't have to go far
To know where you are,
Strangers all give me the news.
I've been living the blues
Ev'ry night without you.
</pre>

<pre class="bridge">
  F
I think that it's best,

I soon get some rest
C      G      C
And forget my pride.
    D
But I can't deny

This feeling that I
G     F       Dm          Em  .  Am . . . F .  /a /b
Carry for you deep down inside.
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
If you see me this way,
You'd come back and you'd stay,
Oh, how could you refuse.
I've been living the blues
Ev'ry night without you.
