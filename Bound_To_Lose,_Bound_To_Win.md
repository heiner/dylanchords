    Well I'm bound to lose, bound to win

    Well, I'm just one of them ramblin' men
    C                D          G
    Ramblin' since I don't know when.
    G                      C
    Here I come, and I'm-a gone again
        /b          D/a   G
    You might think I got no end.

    Bound to lose, I'm bound to win
        G           C              D     G
    I'm bound for a-walkin' to the road again
    G                  Em
    Bound to lose, I'm bound to win
    G                          C     G
    bound for a-walkin' to the road again
