C#m 
What was it you wanted 

Tell me again so I'll know 

What's happening in there, 

What's going on in your show 
F#m 
What was it you wanted 

Could you say it again? 
C#m 
I'll be back in a minute 

You can get it together by then. 

E   G#m    C#m 

What was it you wanted 
You can tell me I'm back 
We can start it all over 
Get it back on the track 
You got my attention 
Go ahead speak 
What was it you wanted 
When you were kissing my cheek? 

Was there somebody looking 
When you gave me that kiss 
Someone there in the shadows 
Someone that I might have missed? 
Is there something you needed 
Something I don't understand. 
What was it you wanted. 
Do I have it here in my hand? 
</pre>

<pre class="bridge">
G#m 
Whatever you wanted 
Slipped out of my mind 
Would you remind me again, 
If you'd be so kind 
Has the record been breaking 
Did the needle just skip 
Is there somebody waiting 
Was there a slip of the lip?
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
What was it you wanted, 
I ain't keeping score 
Are you the same person 
That was here before? 
Is it something important 
Maybe not. 
What was it you wanted? 
Tell me again I forgot. 
</pre>

<pre class="bridge">
Whatever you wanted 
What could it be 
Did somebody tell you 
That you could get it from me 
Is it something that comes natural, 
Is it easy to say, 
Why do you want it, 
Who are you anyway?
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
Is the scenery changing, 
Am I getting it wrong 
Is the whole thing going backwards 
Are they playing our song? 
Where were you when it started 
Do you want it for free 
What was it you wanted 
Are you talking to me? 
</pre>
