                         G                        C
    In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
                        Dm           G               C
    And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand
                        Dm         G                C
    I'm a long way from home and I miss my love one so
                         G                    C
    In the early morning rain with nowhere to go.

    G  C

    Out on runway number nine big 707 set to go
    I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow
    The liquor tasted good and the women all are fast
    There she goes my friend, she's rolling down at last.

    G  C  Dm  G  C

    Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high
    She's away and westward bound far above the clouds she'll fly
    Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines
    She'll be flying over my home in about three hours' time.

    G  C  Dm  G  C

    This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
    'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground cold and drunk as I might be
    You can't hop a jetplane like you can a freight train
                         Dm G                     C
    So I'd best be on my way in the early morning rain.
