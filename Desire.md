<h2>Introductory remarks</h2>
<h3>Eyolf Østrem</h3>
In a <span href="http://oestrem.com/thingstwice/2009/02/things-twice-the-book-now-in-html/#comment-42999" id="Things Twice">blog post</span>, Oisin O’Faghain suggested I write the following about <em>Desire</em>:

<p class="quote">I think Dylan’s best singing is on <em>Desire</em> and Rolling Thunder (the latter being the superior).</p>
<p class="quote"><em>Desire</em> stories (yes i just used “story” as a verb) the crap out of other story albums and yet its “stories” contain questionable biographies “Joey”, “Sara”, “Hurricane”.</p>
<p class="quote">It is (chord-speaking) probably his most straightforward album with major and minor chords, no capo and all standard tuning. A departure, but also lyrically it is a stand-alone album (probably closest to John Wesley Harding) because its lyrics are not complex but yet remain opaque: “Time is an ocean but it ends at the shore”.</p>
So I did. I think I have a thing or two to say about <em>Desire</em> myself, eventually, but until I do, the above stands, with the possible qualification that it should start: “While I listen to <em>Desire</em>, I tend to forget that Dylan’s best singing happened a few years later, during the Gospel period.”
