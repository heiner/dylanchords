## Introductory remarks

### Eyolf Østrem

In a
<a href="http://oestrem.com/thingstwice/2009/02/things-twice-the-book-now-in-html/#comment-42999" id="Things Twice">blog
post</a>, Oisin O'Faghain suggested I write the following about
*Desire*:

I think Dylan's best singing is on *Desire* and Rolling Thunder
(the latter being the superior).

*Desire* stories (yes i just used “story” as a verb) the crap out
of other story albums and yet its “stories” contain questionable
biographies “Joey”, “Sara”, “Hurricane”.

It is (chord-speaking) probably his most straightforward album with
major and minor chords, no capo and all standard tuning. A departure,
but also lyrically it is a stand-alone album (probably closest to John
Wesley Harding) because its lyrics are not complex but yet remain
opaque: “Time is an ocean but it ends at the shore”.

So I did. I think I have a thing or two to say about *Desire*
myself, eventually, but until I do, the above stands, with the possible
qualification that it should start: “While I listen to *Desire*,
I tend to forget that Dylan's best singing happened a few years later,
during the Gospel period.”
