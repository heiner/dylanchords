Written by Bob Dylan, I guess  
Performed by Bob Dylan and the Band in the Basement, summer 1967  
Tabbed by Eyolf Ã˜strem

Too bad the sound is so bad on this, because it's a text with potential.
The bracketed passages are just representations of the sounds I seem to
hear, with no claim for meaning or authority.

I'd suggest a capo on the 5th fret (sounding key D major), with the
following figure going through the whole song:

      A       A6        A       D/a

    [first verse inaudible]

    A
    [Let's take a cherry], I can't make it no more

    Can't stop, she's breaking all time on the floor

    Better come down easy or don't come down at all

    You don't try and to please me, somebody's gonna fall

    D                                      A
    One man's loss always is another man's gain
         E             D                       A
    Yes, one man's joy always is another man's pain

    Eight o'clock in the morning, [better] step aside
    [let me be to your] warning, you better go by
    Three times a loser, number 45
    better not lose her, best stayed alive

    One man's loss always is another man's gain
    Yes, one man's joy always is another man's pain

    Wish I'd have found me [...] at the wall
    One look at the watch, you better [lord at all]
    You can't stop it or wait it [...] at night
    Too hard to keep you waiting, calls me aside

    One man's loss always is another man's gain
    Yes, one man's joy always is another man's pain
