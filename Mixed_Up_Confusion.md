          D7
    I got mixed up confusion
                        G
    Man, it's a-killin' me

    Well, there's too many people
    And they're all too hard to please

    Well, my hat's in my hand
    Babe, I'm walkin' down the line

    An' I'm lookin' for a woman
    Whose head's mixed up like mine

    Well, my head's full of questions
    My temp'rature's risin' fast

    Well, I'm lookin' for some answers
    But I don't know who to ask

    But I'm walkin' and wonderin'
    And my poor feet don't ever stop

    Seein' my reflection
    I'm hung over, hung down, hung up!
