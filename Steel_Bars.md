These definitely are classic “Dylan Lyrics” (shows his well hadn't run
dry), I knew it when I heard it, that it was Dylan. I wonder though, if
the melody and the chords are all his, I sure hope so. Great song. Nice
key change too.

    C        .      .       .
    Dsus4/g  .      .       .

    Bb(add9)
    In the night I hear you speak
                        Dsus4/g
    Turn around, you're in my sleep
    Bb(add9)
    Feel your hands inside your soul
                                    Dsus4/g
    You're holding on and won't let go

    Em                             C
    I've tried running but there's no escape
    Em                              Am7  C     D
    Can't bend them, and (I know) I just can't break these...

    G     D     Em           C
    Steel bars, wrapped all around me
    G               D                  Em      C
     I've been your prisoner since the day you found me
    G             D              Am
     I'm bound forever, till the end of time
    C                                       G
    Steel bars wrapped around this heart of mine

    Trying hard to recognize
    See the face behind the eyes
    Feel your haunting ways like chains
    'Round my heart they still remain

    I'm still running, but there's nowhere to hide
    My love for you has got me locked up inside these...

    Steel bars, wrapped all around me
    I've been your prisoner since the day you found me
    I'm bound forever, till the end of time
    Steel bars wrapped around this heart of mine

    Bm
    And with every step I take

    Every desperate move I make
         G
    It's clear to me
    Bm
    What can all my living mean
         C
    When time itself is so obscene
         Am
    When time itself don't mean a thing
        D
    I'm still loving you

    [<em> a cappella, choir</em>:]
    Steel bars, wrapped all around me
    I've been your prisoner since the day you found me
    I'm bound forever, till the end of time...

(Then the key change.....)


    Ab    Eb    Fm           Db
    Steel bars, wrapped all around me
    Ab              Eb                 Fm      Db
     I've been your prisoner since the day you found me
    Ab            Eb             Bbm
     I'm bound forever, till the end of time
    Db
    Steel bars

How did this unlikely collaboration come about? The following is from a
posting to rec.music.dylan by Olof Bjorner on 16 May 1991:

Michael Bolton: “We're planning on writing some more songs together.
He's kind of hungry to get back out there and wants to work with a few
contemporary hit song writers. Someone who works with Dylan called me up
and said 'Bob Dylan would like to write with you'. I was awed. I told
him, 'I don't even know how I could write a lyric when working with you
... I'm too intimidated'. But then we started messing around with some
chords and wrote Steel Bars, a song about obsession. It took us two
sessions to write, and when I left, I was told, 'Bob likes you and he
wants you to come back'.”
