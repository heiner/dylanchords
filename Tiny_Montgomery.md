    D . . . C . . . D . . . C . . .

    Skinny Moo and
    T-bone Frank
    They're all gonna take on down
    by the Bowning Bank
    One bird book
    And a buzzard and a crow
    Tell 'em all
    That Tiny's gonna say hello

    Scratch your dad
    Do that bird
    Suck that pig
    And bring it on home
    Pink that dream
    And nose that dough
    Tell 'em all
    That Tiny says hello

    Now he's king of the drunks
    An' he squeezes, too
    Watch out, Lester
    Take it, Lou
    Join the monks
    The C.I.O.
    Tell 'em all
    That Tiny Montgomery says hello

    Now grease that gig
    And play it blank
    [tell them to] Go on out
    And gas that dog
    Trick on in
    Flower that smoke
    Take it on down
    begin to grow

    Now, play that low
    And pick it up
    Take it on in
    In a bowled cup
    Three-legged man
    And a hot-lipped hoe
    Tell 'em all
    Montgomery says hello

    Well you can tell ev'rybody
    Down in ol' Frisco
    Tell 'em all
    Montgomery says hello
