Words and music Bob Dylan  
Released on [Under The Red Sky](/wiki/Under The Red Sky "wikilink") (1990)  
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

Sounding key Bb major. I'd suggest a capo somewhere – 1st or 3rd frets
are good suggestions.

Chords:

    Plain    Capo 1st   Capo 3rd
    Bb       A          G
    Eb       D          C
    F        E          D
    Cm       Bm         Am
    Fsus4    Esus4      Dsus4

The “Fsus4” in the last line of the bridge is a chord with a lot of
tones in it – play e.g. Fsus4, F11 or Bb/f.

    Handy dandy,  just like sugar and candy

    Handy dandy, if every bone in his body was broken he would never admit it
    He got an all girl orchestra and when he says
    "Strike up the band", they hit it
    Handy dandy, handy dandy

    You say, "What are ya made of?"

    Handy dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money
    He says, "Darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
    She says, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
    Handy dandy, Handy dandy

    He's got that clear crystal fountain
    He's got that soft silky skin
    He's got that fortress on the mountain
    With no doors, no windows, no thieves can break in

    Handy dandy, sitting with a girl named Nancy in a garden feelin' kind of lazy
    He says, "Ya want a gun? I'll give you one." She says, "Boy, you talking crazy."
    Handy dandy, just like sugar and candy
    Handy dandy, pour him another brandy

    Handy dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full or sorrow
    He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table he says,
    "Okay, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
    Handy dandy, handy dandy, just like sugar and candy
    Handy dandy, just like sugar and candy
