Written by Bob Dylan (and Robbie Robertson, I assume)<br>
Filmed in an unknown hotel room during the 1966 tour, and saved for
posterity on ''Eat The Document''<br>
Lyrics transcribed by Tobias Levander and Arild Langseth (“I Can't
Leave Her Behind”).<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

This is one of the most charming tunes that Dylan has never written --
too bad he didn't finish it. It is also a fascinating study in the
development of song, and in Dylan's composing technique. I assume that
the version called “On a rainy afternoon” or “Does she need me?”
comes first – the “twice as slow” version with the duple time rhythm
that grows out of this, is what appears in “I can't leave her
behind”.

Dylan's guitar is tuned in drop C (C-A-d-g-b-e'), capoed on the fifth
fret, Robbie's is in standard tuning.

The main transcription uses Robbie's guitar. Bbmaj7 = xx8765

Dylan: “OK, we'll do that. I know what I can do and what I can't
do. Hey, get somebody with a pipe down here. OK, let's get this one.”<br>
Robbie: “My pipe is . . ., somebody has it.”<br>
Dylan: “Let's get this one, come on. Ready?”

now. Everything's alright until the last phrase.”

[Dylan: “No, it's twice as slow. Twice as slow. It's too fast. Yeah,
but it can go in there, man, but it's just gonna be twice as slow as

slow. Play every chord about ''twice as slow''”]

The chords in the end aren't exactly what is being played, but it is
what Robbie plays in the beginning, before the song begins.
