Words and music Gordon Lightfoot<br>
Performed by Bob Dylan three times in May 1998<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Ã˜strem

----
A beautiful tune! Much of the effect lies in the hypnotically
ever-descending bass line, with subtly changing chords above it. Also,
the ornaments in the band turn a quite simple country(ish) ballad into
something quite complex.
