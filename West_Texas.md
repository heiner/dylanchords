    I'm goin' down to West Texas
                               [riff]
    Behind the Louisiana line

    I'm goin' down to West Texas
                               [riff]
    Behind the Louisiana line
             A
    Get me a fortune tellin' woman
    "A7"                      D   [riff]
    One that's gonna read my mind

    If you ever go to Dallas
    Take the right hand road
    If you ever go to Dallas
    Take the right hand road
    Those western Dallas streets, boys
    They' bound ta kill ya fo' sho'

    I'm goin' down to Jack Rabbit's
    Past the west Texas line
    I'm goin' down to Jack Rabbit's
    Behind the Texas line
    Eh they's stars up above
    Lord it's my a-leavin' m' sign

    Well you never miss your water
    'till the well runs dry
    An' you never miss your water
    'Till the well runs dry
    An' you never miss your man
    'till he says "Good-bye"

    You can write an' tell m' Mama
    I won't be comin' home tonight
    You can write an' tell my Mother
    I won't be home tonight
