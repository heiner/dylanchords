    G                                   C               (C  D)
    People that are sad, sometimes they wear a frown
    G                                         C
    People that are kings, sometimes they wear a crown
            G
    But the people that don't fit
            D
    Get the only fun they get
                          G              C/g
    [from] People putting people down
                   G
    People putting people down

    You may lose your life, you may lose your family
    You may lose your mind, just to keep your sanity
    But the people that don't fit,
    the only fun they get:
    People puttin' people down
    People putting people down

    C  G
    So cold,
        D               G       (C/g G)
    sometimes it gets so cold

    [Instr. verse]

    People that are glad, sometimes they wear a smile
    People without dreams will walk an extra mile
    But the people that don't fit,
    the only fun they get:
    People puttin' people down
    People puttin' people down

    So cold,
    sometimes it gets so cold

* * * * *

Second verse, not sung by Dylan:

    People without love, sometimes build a fence around
    The garden up above that makes the whole world go 'round
    But all the people that don't fit
    Get the only fun they get
    From people puttin' people down
    People puttin' people down.
