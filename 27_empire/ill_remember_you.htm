C    F/c    C    F/c  

C             F 
I'll remember you 
F/g                          C 
 When I've forgotten all the rest, 
C              F 
You to me were true, 
F/g                 C 
 You to me were the best. 
           C 
When there is no more, 
    C7 
You cut to the core 
F             C/e      Dm      /e  F 
 Quicker than anyone I knew. 
C 
 When I'm all alone 
F 
 In the great unknown, 
F/g           C 
I'll remember you. 

I'll remember you 
At the end of the trail, 
I had so much left to do, 
I had so little time to fail. 
There's some people that 
You don't forget, 
Even though you've only seen 'm 
One time or two. 
When the roses fade 
And I'm in the shade 
I'll remember you.

Bb        F               C 
Didn't I, didn't I try to love you? 
Bb        F               C 
Didn't I, didn't I try to care? 
Bb              F               C 
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you 
         Dm   C/e             F       F/g 
With the rain blowing in your hair?

<pre class="verse">
I'll remember you 
When the wind blows through the piney wood. 
It was you who came right through, 
It was you who understood. 
Though I'd never say 
That I done it the way 
That you'd have liked me to. 
In the end, 
My dear sweet friend, 
I'll remember you.
