The basic rhythm (with numerous variations) is:

      G                 C         G           C      G
      :   .   .   .     :   .     :   .   .   .      :   .   .   .
    |-----------------|---------|-------------0-00-|-3---------------|
    |-----------------|---------|-------------1-11-|-0---------------|
    |-----------------|-0-0---0-|-------------0-00-|-0---------------|
    |-0-0---0-0---0---|-2-2---2-|-0-0---0-0---2-22-|-0-0---0-0---0---|
    |-2-2---2-2---2---|-3-3---3-|-2-2---2-2---3-33-|-2-2---2-2---2---|
    |-3-3---3-3---3---|---------|-3-3---3-3--------|-3-3---3-3---3---|

The line endings are some times embellished with a G/f\#, something like
this:

      :   .   .   .
    |-------------3-33-|-
    |-------------0-00-|-
    |-------------0-00-|-
    |-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-|-

      G                      C          G      C G
    I went to the doctor, he says I'm alright.
      C                                G       C G
    I knew he was lyin', I'm losing my sight.
    C                                      G   C G
    He should have examined the eyes of my mind
    G                D              G          C G
    20/20 vision and walkin' 'round blind.

    She's gone and left, I feel so alone.
    I carry a heart as heavy as stone.
    I knew she was cheatin', I knew all the time
    20/20 vision and walkin' 'round blind.

    With my eyes wide open I lay in my bed.
    If it wasn't for dyin' I wish I was dead. *)
    But this is my punishment, death is too kind
    20/20 vision and walkin' 'round blind.

    You just didn't know her the way that I do.
    You say that she's wicked, and maybe it's true.
    one thing I know, she's no longer mine
    20/20 vision and walkin' 'round blind.

    She's gone, she's gone, oh what shall I do?
    you can't be happy if she's there with you.
    Some day the heart will trouble your mind
    20/20 vision and walkin' 'round blind.

\*) Cf. the end of the story of [Dink's Song](Dink's Song),
as told by John Lomax:

A few months ago I inquired about Dink at Yazoo City, Mississippi, her
home, she had told me. “Done planted up there,” said a Negro woman,
pointing to a nearby tree-clad hill. I could see a few slabs of marble
shining through the low green foliage. Dink had sung me a spiritual
about a lonesome graveyard, with the refrain: “I wouldn't mind dyin' if
dyin' was all!”
