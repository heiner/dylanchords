Words and music Bob Dylan  
Released on [Love And Theft](Love And Theft) (2001)  
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

* * * * *

Chords:

    Bb6    x1303x                 C#o    x45353
    Dm7-5  xx0111 or x5656x       Bb/d   x5333x
    Cm7-5  x3434x                 C9     x35333
    Dm/f   xx3231                 F+     x4322x
    Bo     x23131

A more logical (or at least euphonious) progression at the end of the
intro and other places, would be Bb Bo Cm C\#o. Bb/b matches what Dylan
sings... Euphony never was his middle name anyway.  
The Dm7 at “meet me” sounds like a Dm7-5 in some verses, but since that
clashes with the singing, I'd recommend a plain Dm7.  
The figure at the end of the bridge is transcribed according to what is
played. The chord names in the tab are more or less what results if the
bass and the song are considered; in the text I've suggested a simpler
version that does more or less the same (Dm/f - F+ - F7 - F+).  
And remember: the bass notes that are played too early, which gives the
swing character.

    out in the moonlight alone

    The dusky light the day is losing
    Orchids, poppies, black-eyed susan
    The earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone
    Won't you meet me
    Cm7-5      Dm/f F    Bb     F+
    out in the moonlight alone

    The air is thick and heavy
    All along the levee
    Where the geese into the countryside have flown
    Won't you meet me
    Cm7-5      Dm/f  F    Bb
    out in the moonlight alone

              Gm
    Well, I'm preaching peace and harmony
        Cm
    The blessings of tranquility
        Gm                               C7
    Yet I know when the time is right to strike
      Bb
    I take you 'cross the river, dear
    C7
    You've no need to linger here

    The clouds are turning crimson
    The leaves fall from the limbs and
    The branches cast their shadows over stone
    Won't you meet me
    out in the moonlight alone

    The boulevards of cypress trees
    The masquerade of birds and bees
    The petals pink and white, the wind has blown
    Won't you meet me
    out in the moonlight alone

    The trailing moss in mystic glow
    The purple blossom soft as snow
    My tears keep flowing to the sea.
    Doctor, lawyer, Indian chief
    It takes a thief to catch a thief
    For whom does the bell toll for, love?
    It tolls for you and me.  *)

    Old pulses running through my palm
    The sharp hills are rising from
    Yellow fields with twisted oaks that groan
    Won't you meet me
    out in the moonlight alone

    The trailing moss and mystic glow
    Purple blossoms soft as snow
    My tears keep flowing <strong>without end</strong>
    Doctor, lawyer, Indian chief
    It takes a thief to catch a thief
    For whom does the bell toll for, love? It tolls for you, <strong>my friend</strong>
