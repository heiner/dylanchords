<h1 align="center">&quot;Don't trust me to show you beauty&quot;</h1>

<p align="left">An' I locked myself an' lost the key<br>
An let the symbols take their shape<br>
An' form a foe for me t' fight<br>
T' lash my tongue an' rebel against<br>
An' spit at strong with vomit words<br>
But I learned t' choose my idols well<br>
T' be my voice an' tell my tale<br>
An' help me fight my phantom brawl<br>
An' my first idol was Hank Williams<br>
For he sang about the railroad lines<br>
An' the iron bars an' rattlin' wheels<br>
Left no doubt that they were real<br>
An' my first symbol was the word &quot;beautiful&quot;<br>
For the railroad lines were not beautiful<br>
They were smoky black an' gutter-colored<br>
An' filled with stink an' soot an' dust<br>
An' I'd judge beauty with these rules<br>
An' accept it only 'f it was ugly<br>
An' 'f I could touch it with my hand<br>
For it's only then I'd understand<br>
An' say &quot;yeah this's real&quot;<br>
An' I walked my road an' sung my song<br>
Like a saddened clown<br>
In the circus a my own world --</p>

<p>Cold Irons Bound<br>
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Where Are You Tonight?<br>
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape,<br>
<br>
<br>
Trust Yourself<br>
Don't trust me to show you beauty<br>
When beauty may only turn to rust.<br>
<br>
<br>
Tough Mama<br>
Dark Beauty<br>
Dark Beauty<br>
Dark Beauty<br>
<br>
<br>
Tomorrow is a Long Time<br>
There's beauty in the silver, singin' river,<br>
There's beauty in the sunrise in the sky,<br>
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty<br>
<br>
<br>
Shelter from the Storm<br>
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine.<br>
<br>
<br>
Long Time Gone<br>
So you can have your beauty,<br>
<br>
<br>
Hard Times<br>
2. While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay.<br>
<br>
<br>
Desolation Row<br>
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors<br>
<br>
<br>
Dark Eyes<br>
But I feel nothing for their game where beauty goes unrecognized,
