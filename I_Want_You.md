Capo 5th fret (sounding key F major). I can't guarantee that this is
what he's playing, but it's the most convenient key, especially if you
want to retain that characteristic little turn that goes through the
whole song, which can be played with all the important chords in C
major:

      C                 Em                Am                G
      :   .   .   .     :   .   .   .     :   .   .   .

On the album, this lick is played one octave higher (noted relative to
capo, although it can of course be played without a capo):

      C                 Em                Am                G

The same guitar that plays the swoosh at the end, also plays this, at
the C before the verses:

        C
    The guilty undertaker sighs,
        Em
    The lonesome organ grinder cries,
        Am                               G
    The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.
        F
    The cracked bells and washed-out horns
    G
    Blow into my face with scorn,
             Am
    But it's not that way,
                     G
    I wasn't born to lose you.
      C           Em
    I want you, I want you,
      Am          G
    I want you so bad,
             C
    Honey, I want you.

    The drunken politician leaps
    Upon the street where mothers weep
    And the saviors who are fast asleep,
    They wait for you.
    And I wait for them to interrupt
    Me drinkin' from my broken cup
    And ask me to
    Open up the gate for you.
    I want you, I want you,
    I want you so bad,
    Honey, I want you.

        Em
    Now all my fathers, they've gone down
         Am
    True love they've been without it.
        Em
    But all their daughters put me down
           F              G
    'Cause I don't think about it.

    Well, I return to the Queen of Spades
    And talk with my chambermaid.
    She knows that I'm not afraid
    To look at her.
    She is good to me
    And there's nothing she doesn't see.
    She knows where I'd like to be
    But it doesn't matter.
    I want you, I want you,
    I want you so bad,
    Honey, I want you.

    Now your dancing child with his Chinese suit,
    He spoke to me, I took his flute.
    No, I wasn't very cute to him,
    Was I?
    But I did it, though, because he lied
    Because he took you for a ride
    And because time was on his side
    And because I . . .
    I want you, I want you,
    I want you so bad,
    Honey, I want you.

[Unplugged](Unplugged) version (outtake)

If you don't have this one, do yourself the favor of getting it. It's
worth it, whichever price you have to pay. (Almost).

Slow and sweet.
