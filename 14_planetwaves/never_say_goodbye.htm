<pre class="verse">
D        G            A 
Twilight on the frozen lake
      G             D 
North wind about to break
   G                A 
On footprints in the snow
G            D     G  A  G 
Silence down below. 
</pre>

<pre class="refrain">
       G  C             D
You're beautiful beyond words
       C           G
You're beautiful to me
C               D
You can make me cry
C         G      C  D  C
Never say goodbye.


My dreams are made of iron and steel 
With a big bouquet 
Of roses hanging down 
From the heavens to the ground.
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
The crashing waves roll over me 
As I stand upon the sand 
Wait for you to come 
And grab hold of my hand. 

(chaos...) 

Oh baby baby baby blue 
You've changed you last name, too 
You've turned your hair to brown 
Love to see it hangin' down.
