Written by Woody Guthrie to the tune “This World is not My Home” (See
Manfred Helfert's site for details:
[<http://www.geocities.com/Nashville/3448/iaint.html>](http://www.geocities.com/Nashville/3448/iaint.html))  
Performed by Bob Dylan and The Band at the Woody Guthrie tribute
concert, Carnegie Hall, NY, Jan 20, 1968.  
 Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

The chorus is a cappella – the chords indicate which harmonies they
sing.

The guitar part is probably played with a capo on the 5th fret (see
below).

    C                   F                          C
    I ain't got no home, I'm just a-ramblin' 'round,
    C                                  D               G
    A hard working ramblin' man, and I go from town to town.
    C                   F
    police make it hard  wherever I may go
        C                           G        C
    And I ain't got no home in this world anymore.

    [C          F  C            F        C]
    I ain't got no home in this world anymore.

    I was farmin' on the shares, always I was poor;
    My crops I'd lay away into the banker's store.
    My wife she took down and died upon the cabin floor,
    And I ain't got no home in this world anymore.

    I ain't got no home in this world anymore.

    I ain't got no home, I'm just a-ramblin' 'round,
    A hard working ramblin' man, and I go from town to town.
    police make it hard  wherever I may go
    And I ain't got no home in this world anymore.

    I ain't got no home in this world anymore.

    Well, as I look around, it's mighty plain to see
    This wide open world, she's a funny old place to be;
    The gamblin' man is rich, the workin' man is poor,
    And I ain't got no home in this world anymore.

    [                                     B-C]
    I ain't got no home in this world anymore.

Additional verse, not sung by Dylan:

    My brothers and my sisters are stranded on this road,
    A hot and dusty road that a million feet have trod;
    Rich man took my home and drove me from my door
    And I ain't got no home in this world anymore.
