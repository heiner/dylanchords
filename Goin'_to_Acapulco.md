Words and music Bob Dylan  
Released on [The Basement Tapes](The Basement Tapes "wikilink")
(1967/1975)  
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

Capo 2nd fret (sounding key A major)

The sung chord at “yeah” is a mix of Em, G and C...  
Robbie's solos are probably played without a capo. I've tabbed the first
solo; the others are similar.

The sung lyrics differ from the copyrighted version.

        G                    D
    I'm going down to Rose Marie's
    C                  G
     She never does me wrong.
        G             D
    She puts it to me plain as day
    C                         G
     And gives it to me for a song.
           G               G7
    It's a wicked life but what the hell
          C                  Am
    [and] everybody's got to eat
            G                D
    And I'm just the same as anyone else
                    C                  Am
    When it comes to scratching for my meals *)

    G              C
    Goin' to Acapulco
    G            F
    Goin' on the run.
    G                      C
    Goin' down to see soft gut
    G                  Am
    Goin' to have some fun.
    [n.c.]
    Yeah

    G
    Goin' to have some fun.

    Now, whenever I get up
    And can't find what I need,
    I just make it down to Rose Marie's
    and get something quick to eat.
    It's not a bad way to make a living
    And I ain't complainin' none.
    For I can blow my plum and drink my rum
    And then go on home and have my fun

    Goin' to Acapulco
    Goin' on the run.
    Goin' down to see soft gut
    Goin' to have some fun.
    Yeah
    Goin' to have some fun.

    Now, if someone offers me a joke
    I just say no thanks.
    I try to tell it like it is
    And keep away from pranks.
    Well, everytime, you know, when the well breaks down
    I just go pump on it some.
    Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
    And just sit there waitin' for me to come.

    Goin' to Acapulco
    Goin' on the run.
    Goin' down to see soft gut
    Goin' to have some fun.
    Yeah
    Goin' to have some fun.
