    G
    She's got everything she needs,
             C                      G      C/g G
    She's an artist, she don't look back.
              C
    She's got everything she needs,
                                    G      C/g G

    And paint the daytime black.

    You will start out standing
    Proud to steal her anything she sees.
    You will start out standing
    Proud to steal her anything she sees.
    But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole
    Down upon your knees.

    She never stumbles,
    She's got no place to fall.
    She never stumbles,
    She's got no place to fall.
    She's nobody's child,
    The Law can't touch her at all.

    She wears an Egyptian ring
    That sparkles before she speaks.
    She wears an Egyptian ring
    That sparkles before she speaks.
    She's a hypnotist collector,
    You are a walking antique.

    Bow down to her on Sunday,
    Salute her when her birthday comes.
    Bow down to her on Sunday,
    Salute her when her birthday comes.
    For Halloween give her a trumpet
    And for Christmas, buy her a drum.
