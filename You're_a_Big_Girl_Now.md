Bird on the horizon, sittin' on a fence,
He's singin' his song for me at his own expense
And I'm just like that bird, oh, oh,
Singin' just for you, mm-mm.
I hope that you can hear,
Hear me singin' through these tears.

Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
You've known it all the time, I'm learnin' it these days .
Oh, I know where I can find You, oh, oh,
In somebody's room. m-mm
It's a price I have to pay
You're a big girl all the way.

Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast
Oh, but what a shame that all we've shared can't last.
I can change, I swear, mm-mm
See what you can do, mm-mm.
I can make it through,
You can make it too.

A change in the weather can be extreme
But it ain't like changing horses in midstream
I'm going out of my mind, mm-mm
With a pain that stops and starts, mm-aa
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Ever since we've been apart.

<h2 class="songversion">Rolling Thunder Revue live version (1976)</h2>

Tabbed from Fort Worth, TX May 16, 1976; the ''Hard Rain''
version from Fort Collins a week later is virtually identical.

Two guitars are prominent: Dylan's and Steven Soles' (according to
Trev Gibb, who got this information from David Mansfield)<br>
1st guitar: Capo 4th fret (sounding key: E major); 2nd guitar no capo

Chords (some of these suggestions incorporate the tones in the bass
and other instruments as well):

<pre class="chords">
Cmaj7    There are many alternatives for this one:
x35500 gives the b-c clash that is clearly audible, at least in the intro;
xx5453 is an option, together with G11=3231, if the bass plays the bottom c;
032000 gives the "Em" feeling, and
332000 or x32000 is a more straightforward Cmaj7
xxx987 This is the high ringing guitar in the intro and the first lines of the verses
G11      3x0211. Mute the 5th string with the ring finger - it's not that tricky.
Can also be played as a Dm or a Dm7 (xx0211, xx0231, xx3231 [with Cmaj7=xx5453])
xxx765 (goes with xxx987)
</pre>

The second guitar (probably Dylan) plays these chords without a capo
(and correspondingly the other chords a major third higher than noted
in the tab: E, B, A, and F#m):

Emaj7    xx9890 (for Cmaj7)
