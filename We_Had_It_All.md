Written by Troy Seals and Donny Fritts  
Performed by Bob dylan (with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers) during the
1986 tour  
Tabbed and transcribed by Eyolf Ã˜strem

Dylan is mostly true to the original lyrics, with two noteworthy
exceptions. The most substantial changes are in the bridge, where he
keeps playing around with a different set of lyrics. Unfortunately, the
words aren't clear on the versions that I have (and I present the
transcription well aware that it is wrong), but I get the impression
that the original's nostalgic sentiment is upset: the "remember when"
has become double-edged, and when he sings "And still I try to go back
there as much as I can", it sounds as a curse just as much as a
blessing. (This is based not so much on the widely circulating version
from Mountain View, Aug 5, 1986, as on the alternate version from
another 1986 show that is transcribed below). This shift is enhanced
also by the subtle change in the line "you were the best thing in my
life, I can recall" to " . . . *as* I recall", thereby introducing the
notion that the past may be a nice place to stay, but that there may be
more important places to be.

    C . Am . G(11) . . .  repeat

          C             G/b              Am       C/g
    I can hear that wind   blowin' in my mind
    F               G       F      G       C    Csus4
    Just the way it sounded in the Georgia pine
    C                             G/b             Am   C/g
     But you were always there to answer when I'd call
    F        G             C      F
     You and me, we had it all

    Remember how I use to touch your hair
    Reaching for the feeling that was always there
    You were the best thing in my life, as I recall [I remember]
    You and me, we had it all 

    C   C7       F/c               C
    Yeah, for to live those times again.
    C  C7    F/c             C
    Oh, [...] I remember when
    C               C7                   F/c           C
        And still I try to go back there, as much as I can
    F              C     F             C
     Yes it was so good, yes it was so good
    F                   C     G               C
     You know it was so good, when I was your man.

    [instrumental verse]

    Never will stop believing in your smile [I remember]
    Even though you didn't stay, it was all worth while
    You were the best thing in my life, as I recall [I remember]
    You and me, we had it all
    [You and me, we had it all]

    F           G           C                    Am
    [You and me, we had it, we had it, we had it, we had it all
    You and me, we had it, we had it, we had it, we had it all
    You and me, we had it, we had it, we had it, we had it all
    You and me, we had it, we had it, we had it, we had it all
    You and me, we had it, we had it, we had it, we had it all]
    F       G             C
    You and me, we had it all

Alternate bridge:

    Oh, good old times, relive those days again
    They will come on and judge one time, "remember when?"
    Other times I'll relive all the joy again
