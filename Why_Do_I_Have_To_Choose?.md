Why do I have to choose
       F         C      F    C
and see everybody lose?
                         G
Walk around and sing the blues,
                   C
Well, darling, I refuse.

Love is hard to find
Love of any kind
And love like yours and mine
Creates its own design.

Why do I have to choose
and see everybody lose?
Walk around and sing the blues,
Oh, darling, I refuse.

When I think of her,
then I think of you,
The love is not the same,
but either love is true.

Why do I have to choose
see everybody lose
Walk around and sing the blues,
Well, darling, I refuse.
