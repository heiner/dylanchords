The guitar is slightly low on this one, perhaps as much as a semitone.  
It's hard to tell if the Em on "good-bye" is a mistake or just an
intentional short Em like the at "lips".

    G

               G
    I held her hand
         C           G
    on a cobblestone corner,
                 Em G
    I kissed her lips
           C     G
    by the river bridge
               (Em) G
    I said good-bye
          C            G
    with a night train rolling
                  C D
    on a lonesome day
                    C     G
    by the lonesome river edge.

    No, that's not the one I was thinking of.
