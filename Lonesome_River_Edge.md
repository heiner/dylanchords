Trad. <br>
Performed by Bob Dylan on the so-called Banjo tape, recorded in the basement of Gerde's folk city Feb 8, 1963, with Happy Traum<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Ã˜strem

----
The guitar is slightly low on this one, perhaps as much as a semitone.<br>
It's hard to tell if the Em on "good-bye" is a mistake or just an intentional short Em like the at "lips".

G

           G
I held her hand
     C           G
on a cobblestone corner,
             Em G
I kissed her lips
       C     G
by the river bridge
           (Em) G
I said good-bye
      C            G
with a night train rolling
              C D
on a lonesome day
                C     G
by the lonesome river edge.
