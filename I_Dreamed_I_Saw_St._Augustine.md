Capo 5th fret (sounding key F major)

The F in the final line is perhaps (and could definitely be) played as
an Fmaj7: x33210, which comes very smoothely from the preceeding C/g:
332010.  
The C/b in the penultimate line is probably a x20010 chord rather than
the “correct” x22010.

    C
    I dreamed I saw St. Augustine,
     F              C
    Alive as you or me,

    Tearing through these quarters
           D7         F
    In the utmost misery,
           C
    With a blanket underneath his arm
          F
    And a coat of solid gold,
    C         /b      Am   C/g
    Searching for the very souls
           F               C
    Whom already have been sold.

    "Arise, arise," he cried so loud,
    With a voice without restraint,
    "Come out, ye gifted kings and queens
    And hear my sad complaint.
    No martyr is among ye now
    Whom you can call your own,
    But go on your way accordingly
    And know you're not alone."

    [Harmonica verse]

    I dreamed I saw St. Augustine,
    Alive with fiery breath,
    And I dreamed I was amongst the ones
    That put him out to death.
    Oh, I awoke in anger,
    So alone and terrified,
    I put my fingers against the glass
    And bowed my head and cried.
