    [1 verse instrumental intro]

            A                D                               A
    Well, I see you got your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
           D                                                A
    Yes, I see you got your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
                   E
    Well, you must tell me, baby
                                             A
    How your head feels under somethin' like that
     (turnaround)                                   E7
    Under your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat

    Well, you look so pretty in it *)
    Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
    Yes, I just wanna see
    If it's really the expensive kind
    You know it balances on your head
    Just like a mattress balances
    On a bottle of wine
    Your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat

    Well, if you wanna see the sun rise
    Honey, I know where
    We'll go out and see it sometime
    We'll both just sit there and stare
    Me with my belt
    Wrapped around my head
    And you just sittin' there
    In your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat

    Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you
    It's bad for your health, he said
    Yes, I disobeyed his orders
    I came to see you
    But I found him there instead
    You know, I don't mind him cheatin' on me
    But I sure wish he'd take that off his head
    Your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat

    Well, I see you got a new boyfriend
    You know, I never seen him before
    Well, I saw him
    Makin' love to you
    You forgot to close the garage door
    You might think he loves you for your money
    But I know what he really loves you for
    It's your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat

Mostly not-so-finished lyrics, compared to the released version, but
also a different intro:

    Well, I see you got your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
    Yes, I see you got your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
    Well, tell me now, baby, how's your head feel, under that,
    Under your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat

    Well, you wear it so pretty, honey, can I jump on it sometime?
    Well, you wear it so pretty, can I jump on it sometime?
    You know it balances on your head just like a mattress balances
    On a bottle of wine
    Your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat

    Well, if you wanna see the sun, honey, I know where
    Mmmm, if you wanna see the sun, we'll just sit there and stare
    Me with my belt wrapped around my head, and you just sittin' there
    In your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat

    Well, I asked the doctor could I see you
    but he said it was bad for my health, he said
    Well, I disobeyed his orders
    I came to see you and found him there instead
    Well, I don't mind he's cheating
    But how come he was wearing on his
    Your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat?

    Well, I see you got a new boyfriend; well, I don't wanna see him no more.
    Well, I saw you makin' love with him, you forgot to close the garage door
    You might think he loves you for your money
    But that ain't true, I know what he really loves you for:
    Your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat

    Well I don't drink whiskey, no, I don't drink gin
    But I'm so dirty honey, I've been working all day in the coal bin
    Right now I wanna see you, honey, will you let me in?
    Your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat

    Well, can I be your chaufueur, honey, can I be your chauffeur?
    Well, you can ride with me, honey I'll be your chaufeur
    just as long as you stay in the car -
    if you get out and start to walk, you just might topple over
    in your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
