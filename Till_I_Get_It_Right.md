C
I'll just keep on

falling in love
D/c
till I get it right
F
 Right now I'm like
G
 a wounded bird
C               Gm7  C7
 Hungry for the sky
F
 But if I try my way,
        G    (E7/g#)
and try long enough,
    C7/Bb                 F
I'm bound to learn how to fly
D7/f#
 So I'll just keep fallin',
F           G
 fallin' in love
C       F/c    C
 Till I get it right

My door of love
has opened out
More times than in
And I'm either a fool,
or a wiser woman
To open it again
Cause I'll never know
what's beyond the mountain
till I reach the other side
So I'll just keep on,
falling in love
Till I get it right

Gm7
 If practice makes perfect,
C7                   F                 Ab
 then I'm as perfect as I'll ever be
D
So I'll just keep on,
F           G
 falling in love
C             D/c
Till I get it right
F       G11    C
[Till I get it right]

fallin' in love
                      F     G11
I'm gonna keep fallin',

till I, till I, till I get it right
