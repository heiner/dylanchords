Written by Bob Dylan  
Recorded Aug 1963 as a Witmark Demo  
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

* * * * *

Open E tuning (or open D with capo 2nd fret)

Chords:

    E    000000
    A    020100 (actually A/e)
    A/c# x20100
    B7   x02100 (or 202100)

Although this can't exactly be called a complicated song, the last line
is treated differently in almost all the verses. Three common
alternatives to the version chosen below, are to make it identical to
the penultimate line, to let the A fall on “Lou”, or to drop the B7.

           E                A          E
    If you getcha one girl, better get two
    A        E        B7    E
    Case you run into Gypsy Lou
            E                     A        E
    She's a ramblin' woman with a ramblin' mind
    A       E         B7    E
    Leavin' some poor boy behind.
    A/c#            E    A E
    Hey, 'round the bend
    A     E     B7    E
    Gypsy Lou's gone again
    A           (B7)  E
    Gypsy Lou's gone again.

    Well, I seen this whole country through
    Just to followin' Gypsy Lou
    Seen it up, seen it down
    Followin' Gypsy Lou around.
    Hey, 'round the bend
    Gypsy Lou's gone again
    Gypsy Lou's gone again.

    Well, I gotta stop and take some rest
    My poor feet are second best
    My poor feet are wearin' thin
    Gypsy Lou's gone again.
    Hey, gone again
    Gypsy Lou's 'round the bend
    Gypsy Lou's 'round the bend.

    Well, seen her up in old Cheyenne
    Turned my head and away she ran
    From Denver Town to Wichita
    Last I heard she's in Arkansas.
    Hey, 'round the bend
    Gypsy Lou's gone again
    Gypsy Lou's gone again

    Well, I tell you what if you want to do
    Tell you if you'll wear out your shoes
    If you want to wear out your shoes
    Try and follow Gypsy Lou.
    Hey, gone again
    Gypsy Lou's 'round the bend
    Gypsy Lou's 'round the bend.

    Well, Gypsy Lou, I been told
    Livin' down on Gallus Road
    Gallus Road, Arlington
    Moved away to Washington.
    Hey, 'round the bend
    Gypsy Lou's gone again
    Gypsy Lou's gone again

    Well, I went down to Washington
    Then she went to Oregon
    I skipped the ground and hopped a train
    She's back in Gallus Road again.
    Hey, I can't win
    Gypsy Lou's gone again
    Gypsy Lou's gone again

    Well, the last I heard of Gypsy Lou
    She's in a Memphis calaboose
    She left one too many a boy behind
    He committed suicide.
    Hey, you can't win
    Gypsy Lou's gone again
    Gypsy Lou's gone again
