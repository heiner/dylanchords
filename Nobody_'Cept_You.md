    G              D                 G
    Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred
          Em        C
    'Cept you, yeah you
            G             D               G
    there's nothing round here to me that matters
          Em        C
    'Cept you, yeah you

    C
    You're the one that reaches me
               G
    You're the one that I admire
    C
    Every time we meet together
      G
    I feel like I'm on fire
    C
    Nothing matters to me
                G           Em
    And there's nothing I desire
          C         Am
    'Cept you, yeah you

    Nothing 'round here I care to try for
    'Cept you, yeah you
    Got nothing here to live or die for
    'Cept you, yeah you

    There's a hymn I used to hear
    In the churches all the time
    Make me feel so good inside
    So peaceful, so sublime
    And there's nothing that reminds me of that
    Old familiar chime
    Except you, uh huh you

    C
    Used to run in the cemetery
                                        G
    Dance and run and sing when I was a child

    and it never seemed strange
    C
    Now I just pass mournfully
                                              G
    By that place where the bones of life are piled

    I know somethin' has changed

    I'm a stranger here and no one sees me
    'Cept you, yeah you
    Nothing anymore seems to please me
    'Cept you, yeah you

    Nothing hypnotizes me
    Or holds me in a spell
    Everything runs by me
    Just like water from a well
    Everybody wants my attention
    Ev'rybody got something to sell
    'Cept you, yeah you.

    Am               G
    I'm in love with you.
