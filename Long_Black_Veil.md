Written by M.J.Wilkin and D.Dil  
Performed twice by Bob Dylan, in Wheeling, West Virginia, 28 April 1997
(electric) and in George, Washington, June 17, 2000 (acoustic)  
Tabbed by Eyolf Ã˜strem

Below is the acoustic version from 2000. The electric version is played
in E (chords: E, B and A), and it's much slower. Otherwise it's
basically the same arrangement.

    C               (Csus4 C)
    Ten years ago on a     cold dark night
    G                           F            C
    Someone was shot 'neath the town hall light
        C           Csus4         C           Csus4 C
    The people who saw, well they all agreed
             G                        F          C   Csus4 C
    That the slayer that ran looked a lot like me

    The judge said "Son, what is your alibi?
    If you were somewhere else you won't have to die"
    I spoke not a word though it meant my life
    I had been in the arms of my best friend's wife

        F           C          F          C
    She walks these hills in a long black veil
    F         C              F           C
    Visits my grave when the night winds wail
    C                F      C
    Nobody knows and nobody sees
    F      G         C     Csus4 C
    Nobody knows but me

    C . . . | C . . . |
    G . . . | F . C . |

    The scaffold was high, eternity near
    She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
    But sometimes at night when the cold wind moans
    In a long black veil she shivers over my bones

    She walks these hills in a long black veil
    Visits my grave when the night winds wail
    Nobody knows, nobody sees
    Nobody knows but me
