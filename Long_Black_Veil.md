Performed twice by Bob Dylan, in Wheeling, West Virginia, 28 April
1997 (electric) and in George, Washington, June 17, 2000 (acoustic)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Ã˜strem

Below is the acoustic version from 2000. The electric version is
played in E (chords: E, B and A), and it's much slower. Otherwise it's
basically the same arrangement.

C               (Csus4 C)
Ten years ago on a     cold dark night
G                           F            C
Someone was shot 'neath the town hall light
    C           Csus4         C           Csus4 C
The people who saw, well they all agreed
         G                        F          C   Csus4 C
That the slayer that ran looked a lot like me

The judge said "Son, what is your alibi?
If you were somewhere else you won't have to die"
I spoke not a word though it meant my life
I had been in the arms of my best friend's wife

    F           C          F          C
She walks these hills in a long black veil
F         C              F           C
Visits my grave when the night winds wail
C                F      C
Nobody knows and nobody sees
F      G         C     Csus4 C
Nobody knows but me

C . . . | C . . . |

<pre class="verse">
The scaffold was high, eternity near
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But sometimes at night when the cold wind moans
In a long black veil she shivers over my bones
</pre>

<pre class="refrain">
She walks these hills in a long black veil
Visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me
</pre>
