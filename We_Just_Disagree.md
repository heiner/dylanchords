Been away, haven't seen you in a while
           Bb             Dm      C    Dm
How've you been, have you changed your style?
            F              Bb/d              C
What do you think, have we grown up differently?
               Bb                   Dm   C    Dm
Don't feel the same, seems like you lost your feel
    F
for me.

         Bb    C   F
So let's leave it alone
       Bb        C      F
Cos we don't see eye to eye
     (/g)      F/a      Bb
There ain't no good guy
               F/a     Bb
There ain't no bad guy
        (/c) Dm             Bb      C   F
There's only you and me and we just disagree.

<pre class="verse">
I'm goin back to a place that's far away
How 'bout you, have you got a place to stay
Why should I care, I'm just trying to get along
We were friends, now it's the end of our love song.

<pre class="refrain">
So let's leave it alone
Cos we don't see eye to eye
There ain't no good guy
There ain't no bad guy
There's only you and me and we just disagree.
