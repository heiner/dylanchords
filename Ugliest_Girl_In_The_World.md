    A
    Well the woman that I love she got a hook in her nose

    Her eye brows meet she wears second hand clothes
        D
    She speaks with a stutter and she walks with a hop
      A
    I don't know why I love her but I just can't stop.
        D               A
    You know I love her yeah I love her
    E                                        A
    I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world.

    If I ever lose her I will go insane
    I go half crazy when she calls my name
    When she says "ba-ba-ba-ba-baby I l'-l'-love you
    There ain't nothing in the world that I wouldn't do.
    You know I love her yeah I love her
    I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world.

    The woman that I love she got two flat feet
    Her knees knocks together walking down the street
    She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed
    She ain't much to look at but like I said:
    I love her Yeah I love her
    I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world

    (She's so ugly
    Man she's ugly
    definitely (?) ugly
    truly ugly
    She's so ugly
    She's so ugly)

    I don't mean to say she got nothing going
    She got a weird sense of humor that is all her own
    When I got low she sets me on my feet
    Got a five inch smile but her breath is sweet.
    You know I love her Yeah I love her
    I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world.

    Well the woman that I love she got a hook in her nose
    Her eye brows meet she wears second hand clothes
    She speaks with a stutter and she walks with a hop
    I don't know why I love her but I just can't stop.
    You know I love her yeah I love her
    I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world.
