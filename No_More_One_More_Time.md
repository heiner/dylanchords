    Baby I might be crazy
             D                      D7
    but I'll never call you baby anymore
    G                 G7/b
    You had your last second chance
    C                    Am
    at this old heart of mine

    I'd like to say, but I can't say that it's been fun
    You had my heart locked away in the dark and it could use some sun
    I'm gonna miss you a lot, honey I got to let you go
    So go ahead and try, you might even cry, you never know

    There'll be no more one more time
    Baby I might be crazy
    and I'll never call you baby anymore
    You had your last second chance
    at this old heart of mine
    And there'll be no more one more time

    You had your last second chance
    at this old heart of mine
    And there'll be no more one more
