<pre class="verse">
B
I'm gonna walk across the desert 'til I'm in my right mind.

I won't even think about what I left behind.

Nothing back there anyway I can call my own.

Go back home, leave me alone.
</pre>
<pre class="refrain">
E                                         B
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
F#                          E                                         B
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday.

<pre class="verse">
Ever since the British burned the White House down
There's a bleeding wound in the heart of town
I saw you drinking of an empty cup
I saw you buried, and I saw you dug up.
</pre>
<pre class="refrain">
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday.
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
Look down, Angel from the skies!
Help my weary soul to rise!
I kissed the cheek, I dragged your plow.
You broke my heart, I was your friend 'til now.
</pre>
<pre class="refrain">
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday.
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
In the courtyard of the golden sun
You stand and fight, or you break and run.
You went and lost your lovely head
For a drink of wine and a crust of bread.
</pre>
<pre class="refrain">
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday.
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
We looted and we plundered on distant shores.
Why is my share not equal to yours?
Your father left you, your mother too.
Even death has washed its hands of you.
</pre>
<pre class="refrain">
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday.
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
This is hard country to stay alive in.
Blades are everywhere, and they're breaking my skin.
I'm armed to the hilt, and I'm struggling hard.
You won't get out of here unscarred.
</pre>
<pre class="refrain">
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I cant work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday.
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
You got too many lovers wailin' at the wall.
If I had a thousand tongues, I couldn't count them all.
Yesterday, I could've thrown them all in the sea,
Today, even one may be too much for me.
</pre>
<pre class="refrain">
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday.
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
Cakewalking baby, you can do no wrong
Put your arms around me where they belong.
I won't take you on a roller coaster ride.
Lay my hands all over ya, tie you to my side.
</pre>
<pre class="refrain">
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday.
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
I've got a heavy-stacked woman with a smile on her face,
And she has crowned my soul with grace.
I'm still hurting from an arrow that pierced my chest
I'm gonna have to take my head and bury it between your breasts.
</pre>
<pre class="refrain">
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday.
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
Been dark all night, but now it's dawn.
The moving finger is moving on.
You can guard me while I sleep,
Kiss away the tears I weep.
</pre>
<pre class="refrain">
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday.
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
I love women, and she loves men.
We've been to the West, and we're going back again.
I heard a voice at the dusk of day
Saying, "Be gentle brother, be gentle and pray."
</pre>
<pre class="refrain">
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday.
