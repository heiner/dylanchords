Capo 2nd fret (original key D major)

The following figure is the basis of the fingerpicking pattern that he
uses throughout, but with many variations along the way. Don't bother
too much about the exact strings neither of the thumb nor the middle
strings – what matters is the steady thumb against the syncopated rhythm
of the upper strings:

    He was a friend of mine

    Every time I think about him now

    Lord I just can't keep from cryin'
           C/g G7                C/g
    'Cause he    was a friend of mine

    He died on the road
    He died on the road
    He never had enough money
    To pay his room or board
    And he was a friend of mine

    I stole away and cried
    I stole away and cried
    'Cause I never had too much money
    And I never been quite satisfied
    And he was a friend of mine

    He never done no wrong
    He never done no wrong
    A thousand miles from home
    And he never harmed no one
    And he was a friend of mine

    He was a friend of mine
    He was a friend of mine
    Every time I hear his name
    Lord I just can't keep from cryin'
    'Cause he was a friend of mine.
