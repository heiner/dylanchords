Written by Ralph and Carter Stanley  
Sung by Bob Dylan and Ralph Stanley on Ralph Stanley &amp; Friends:
*Clinch Mountain Country* (1998)  
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

The intro is played on a mandolin, of course. Below is an approximative
adaptation to the guitar (put a half barré on the 2nd fret in the third
bar, and slide the whole barre up from the 1st fret on the fourth beat -
the 1-2 on the 2nd string).

                A
    I sit here alone on the banks of the river
                      D                        A
    The lonseome wind blows and the water runs high
                       D                            A
    I can hear a voice call [from] out there in the darkness
                    E                    A
    But I sit here alone too lonesome to cry

                       A
    Oh the water rolls high on the river at midnight

    I sit on the shore too grievin' to cry

    The woman I love she left me this morning
                   E                   A
    With no-one to love or kiss me goodnight

    We met there one night on the banks of the river
    sat there holdin' hands and makin' a vow
    That we never would part and be happy together
    But the new love she's found - she's gone with him now.

    Oh the water rolls high on the river at midnight
    I sit on the shore too grievin' to cry
    The woman I love she left me this morning
    With no-one to love or kiss me goodnight
