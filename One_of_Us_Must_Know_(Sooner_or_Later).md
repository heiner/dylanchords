Words and music Bob Dylan  
Released on [Blonde on Blonde](Blonde on Blonde) (1966)  
Tabbed by Eyolf Ã˜strem

* * * * *

Capo 5th fret (sounding key F major)  
The 2nd guitar is probably playing with a capo on the 1st fret and
chords in E major

\*) If you include the note in the piano here, you would get a Dm/f
chord

In the refrain there is a nice bass line that one can get by playing the
chords:

    C . G/b . |F/a . C/g . |F . C/e . |G

BTW, this is the same line as in the refrain of Sad-Eyed Lady.

      C                        F*) C
    I didn't mean to treat you so bad
    F             C      (F) G(sus4)      G
    You shouldn't take it so personal
      C                       F  C
    I didn't mean to make you so sad
    F        C          (F) G               (Gsus4-G)
    You just happened to be there, that's all
    Am                                   Em
    When I saw you say "goodbye" to your friend and smile
    Dm                         C
    I thought that it was well understood
    Am                             Em
    That you'd be comin' back in a little while
    Dm                                     F              G
      I didn't know that you were sayin' "goodbye" for good

         C         G      F              C
    But, sooner or later, one of us must know
    F             C                  G
    That you just did what you're supposed to do
    C         G      F              C
    Sooner or later, one of us must know
    F             C              G
    That I really did try to get close to you

    I couldn't see what you could show me
    Your scarf had kept your mouth well hid
    I couldn't see how you could know me
    But you said you knew me and I believed you did
    When you whispered in my ear
    And asked me if I was leavin' with you or her
    I didn't realize just what I did hear
    I didn't realize how young you were

    But, sooner or later, one of us must know
    You just did what you're supposed to do
    Sooner or later, one of us must know
    That I really did try to get close to you

    I couldn't see when it started snowin'
    Your voice was all that I heard
    I couldn't see where we were goin'
    But you said you knew an' I took your word
    And then you told me later, as I apologized
    That you were just kiddin' me, you weren't really from the farm
    An' I told you, as you clawed out my eyes
    That I never really meant to do you any harm

    But, sooner or later, one of us must know
    You just did what you're supposed to do
    Sooner or later, one of us must know
    That I really did try to get close to you
