    A
     I stand in awe and I take my place *)

    You break your promise all over the place
        D7
    You promised to love me, but what do I see
    A
     Just you comin' and spillin' juice over me

    E7
    Odds and ends, odds and ends
    A [n.c.]
    Lost time is not found again

    Now, you take your file and you bend my head
    I never can remember anything that you said **)
    You promised to love me, but what do I know
    You're always spillin' juice on me like you got someplace to go

    Odds and ends, odds and ends
    Lost time is not found again

    Now, I've had enough, my box is clean
    You know what I'm sayin' and you know what I mean
    From now on you'd best get on someone else
    While you're doin' it, keep that juice to yourself

    Odds and ends, odds and ends
    Lost time is not found again
