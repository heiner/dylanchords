<pre class="verse">
A
 I stand in awe and I take my place *)

You break your promise all over the place
    D7
You promised to love me, but what do I see
A
 Just you comin' and spillin' juice over me
</pre>

<pre class="refrain">
E7
Odds and ends, odds and ends
A [n.c.]
Lost time is not found again
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
Now, you take your file and you bend my head
I never can remember anything that you said **)
You promised to love me, but what do I know
You're always spillin' juice on me like you got someplace to go
</pre>

<pre class="refrain">
Odds and ends, odds and ends
Lost time is not found again
</pre>

<pre class="
verse">
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean
You know what I'm sayin' and you know what I mean
From now on you'd best get on someone else
While you're doin' it, keep that juice to yourself
</pre>

<pre class="refrain">
Odds and ends, odds and ends
Lost time is not found again
</pre>
