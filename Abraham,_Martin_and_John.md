Written by Dick Holler<br>
Performed by Bob Dylan during the 1980 and 1981 gospel tours, in duet
with Clydie King.<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Ã˜strem

Played with Bob at the piano, in C# major. I'd strongly suggest a
capo on the 1st fret.

C            Em  F                   C
 Has anybody here seen my old friend Abraham?
C        Em                 F           C/e F
 Can you tell me where he's gone?
                  Gsus4   G
He freed a lot of people,
       F                  C
But it seems the good die young,
      F            G              F    C/e  Dm  C
Now I just looked around and he's gone.

F

Has anybody here seen my old friend John?
Can you tell me where he's gone?
He freed a lot of people,
But it seems the good die young,
Now I just looked around and he's gone.

Has anybody here seen my old friend Martin?
Can you tell me where he's gone?
He freed a lot of people,
But it seems the good die young,
Now I just looked around and he's gone.

F          G        F                C
Didn't you love the things that they stood for?
F           G      F                  C
Didn't they try to find some good for you and me?
    Gm       F         C
An' we'll be free, someday
G11
I know, free one day.

Has anybody here seen my old friend Bobby?
Can you tell me where he's gone?
Thought I see them walkin'
Up over the hill
With Abraham, Martin and John
Abraham, Martin and John.
