        A      
Well, a  marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred

The man put us together, now, you wanna make it
        D
Stick together
                          A
Come on, come on, stick together.
              E                                    A
You know, we made a vow, not to leave one another, never

Well, ya never miss you water till your well runs dry
Come one, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together
Come on, come on, stick together
We made a vow, not to leave one another, never.

Well, ya never miss your water till your well runs dry
Come one, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together
Come on, come on, stick together
You know, we made a vow, not to leave one another, never.

It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy
Let's stick together
Come on, come on, stick together
You know, we made a vow, not to leave one another, never.
