The *Bootleg Series* version is the same as below, only played at the

The *[Unplugged](Unplugged "wikilink")* version is also the same as
below, only with a capo on the 2nd fret.

         G             Em
    Come gather 'round people
        C        G
    Wherever you roam
          G            Em
    And admit that the waters
     C              D
    Around you have grown
          G            Em
    And accept it that soon
              C               G
    You'll be drenched to the bone.
            G       Am           D
    If your time to you Is worth savin'
             D            D2/c
    Then you better start swimmin'
              G/b         D/a
    Or you'll sink like a stone
            G     C *)       D   G . .            *) Not played in the first verse
    For the times they are a-changin'.

    G . . | Em . . | C . . | G . . | . . . | . . . | . . .

    Come writers and critics
    Who prophesize with your pen
    And keep your eyes wide
    The chance won't come again
    And don't speak too soon
    For the wheel's still in spin
    And there's no tellin' who that it's namin'.
    'Cause the loser now
    Will be later to win
    For the times they are a-changin'.

    Come senators, congressmen
    Please heed the call
    Don't stand in the doorway
    Don't block up the hall
    For he that gets hurt
    Will be he who has stalled
    The battle outside ragin'
    Will soon shake your windows *)
    And rattle your walls
    For the times they are a-changin'.

    Come mothers and fathers
    Throughout the land
    And don't criticize
    What you can't understand
    Your sons and your daughters
    Are beyond your command
    Your old road is rapidly agin'.
    Please get out of the new one
    If you can't lend your hand
    For the times they are a-changin'.

    The line it is drawn
    The curse it is cast
    The slow one now
    Will later be fast
    As the present now
    Will later be past
    The order is rapidly fadin'.
    And the first one now
    Will later be last
    For the times they are a-changin'.

\*) The official lyrics have:

There's a battle outside and it is ragin'.  
It'll soon shake your windows

Alternate studio version (Oct 1963)

</h2>
Released as a bonus track on the limited edition of *“Love and Theft”
(2001)*.  
This version combines two well-known Dylan features, the G-G6-G7 figure
and the high capo position, in a song that's usually played in G.

Capo 5th fret (sounding key F major)

The “G-G6-G7” figure in its two versions:

      G       G6    G7                  G   G6  G7

Alternatives for the next to last lines (“then you better...--...like a
stone”):

    G7 . . | G6 . . | F . . | G G6 G7 | (verses 2 and 4)

    G7 . . | G6 . . | G(6) . . | G . . | (last verse; G6=322000, G(6)=320000)

Alternative for the last line (3rd verse):

    C . . | F C G | G G6 G7| C

Lyrically the only change is that he sings “vibrate your walls” instead
of “rattle your walls” in the third verse.

Live version from Drammenshallen, July 10, 1981

</h2>
This is a very special version, not only because it was on the first
bootleg I ever got, or because it was a one-off opener during that tour,
or because of the delightful error in the second verse, or because it
was played not far from where I stayed at the time (not that I had the
slightest idea, just a kid acting smart at the time) -- but for all
these reasons taken together.

Chords:

    G6         xx9780
