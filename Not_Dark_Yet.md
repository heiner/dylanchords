Words and music by Bob Dylan  
Released on [Time out of Mind](/wiki/Time out of Mind "wikilink") (1997)  
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

Sounds very C major-ish in the chords, but can of course be played in E
directly. The C/g chords of the second part of the verse contain a D on
some occasions.  
Once again:Capo 4th fret (original key E major)

    C                  F/c                  C
    Shadows are falling and I been here all day
                        F/c                    C
    It's too hot to sleep and time is running away
    G            G/f      C/e         C
    Feel like my soul has turned into steel
    Am                 C/g            F          C
    I've still got the scars that the sun didn't heal
    G                G/f            C/e     C
    There's not even room enough to be anywhere
    Am       C/g      F                     C
    It's not dark yet, but it's getting there

    Well my sense of humanity is going down the drain
    Behind every beautiful thing, there's been some kind of pain
    She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind
    She put down in writin' what was in her mind
    I just don't see why I should even care
    It's not dark yet, but it's getting there

    Well I been to London and I been to gay Paris
    I followed the river and I got to the sea
    I've been down to the bottom of a world full of lies
    I ain't lookin for nothin' in anyone's eyes
    Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear
    It's not dark yet, but it's getting there

    I was born here and I'll die here, against my will*)
    I know it looks like I'm movin' but I'm standin' still
    Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb
    I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from
    Don't even hear the murmur of a prayer
    It's not dark yet, but it's getting there

\*)*From a recension by Martin Grossman*

<strong>Dylan the Talmudist </strong>

In the last verse of “Not Dark Yet,” Dylan paraphrases lines from the
Pirke Avot, which lends credence to the rumors that he has been studying
Talmud in recent years. He sings,

1.  *I was born here and I'll die here against my will*

In the Pirke Avot (Ethics of the Fathers), 4:29, the language is
strikingly similar:

1.  *“And not let your evil inclination assure you that the grave will
    be a place of refuge for you – for against your will you were
    created, against your will you were born, against your will you
    live, against your will you die, and against your will you are
    destined to give an account before the Supreme King of Kings, the
    Holy One Blessed be He.”*
