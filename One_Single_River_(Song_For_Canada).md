    G

                                   E
    How come we can't talk to each other any more?
    Am            D7               G
    Why can't you see I'm changing too?
    G                             E
     We've got by far too long to end it feeling wrong
    Am                              D
    And I still share too much with you

    Em                          D
    Just one great river always flowing to the sea
    Em                       D
    One single river rolling in eternity
    G                             E
    Two nations in this land that lies along its shore
    Am            D             G
     But just one river rolling free.

    How come you shut me out as if I wasn't there
    What's this new bitterness you've found?
    However wronged you were, however strong it hurt
    It wasn't me who held you down.

    One single river always flowing to the sea
    One single river rolling in eternity
    Two nations in this land that lies along its shore
    But just one river rolling free.

    [Instrumental verse + refrain]

    Why can't you understand I'm glad you're standing proud
    I know you made it on your own
    But in this new pride you've earned, I thought you might have learned
    That you don't have to stand alone

    Lonely northern river always flowing to the sea
    One single river rolling in eternity
    Two nations in this land that lies along its shore
    But just one river rolling free.
