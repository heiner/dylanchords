    D                    A
     Soft as a rain drop, fresh as the sea
                         D
    Warm as the sunshine  shinin' on me
    G     A      D     G     A      D
     This was my love,  this was my love.

    Light was her laughter, few were her tears
    Gentle her beauty, tender her years
    This was my love, this was my love.   D7

    G             F#m   Em                D
     So young, so fair,  such soft golden hair
    G             A      D
     Smile always on her face
    G         F#m Em           D
    No other love  can ever compare
       C         A        D
    No other can take her place.

    Others may cherish fortune or fame
    I will forever cherish her name
    This was my love, this was my love.

    So young, so fair, such long golden hair
    Smile always on her face
    No other love can't ever compare
    No other can take her place.

    Others may cherish fortune of fame
    I will forever cherish her name
    This was my love, this was my love
