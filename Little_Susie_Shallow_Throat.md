Written by David Allan Coe.  
Included as the 22nd track on the bootleg CD *Hard to find*, Which is
the only Dylan connection.  
So, it doesn't belong here (it doesn't belong anywhere really)(but it's
kinda funny though), for any other reason than that it reminds me of
Litte Sadie and Lonesome Suzie, and because of the subtle reference to
''Ballad of a thin Man ''(both the "thin" – "shallow" pair, the "you try
so hard" – "no matter how she tried", and that "Mr Jones" in *Don't Look
Back*, seems like a real dick).

    Little Susie Shallow Throat was lonely
    D                  G      /f#    Em       A
    All the girls made fun of her at school
              G              A
    'Cause no matter how she tried
                  D            G
    she could not get a dick inside
        /f#     Em
    her shallow throat,
            A      Asus4  A
    shallow throat.

    Hot Dogs and bananas were too big
    G     /f#     A         D                   G
    cucumbers and sausages, they just would not fit
        /f#        A/e    Asus4  A
    she tried them all.

    The football team all tried to give her lessons
    she practiced but she threw up on the coach
    not one man on the squad
    ever shot his wad
    in Susie's throat,
    shallow throat.

    Hot Dogs and bananas were too big
    cucumbers and sausages, they just would not fit
    she tried them all.

    The drum major was a boy named Slick
    Who had a very little-bitty dick
    She licked it, sucked and stroked it
    'Til Slick thought she might choke,
    he never knew
        A             D
    she had a shallow throat.

    Hot Dogs and bananas were too big
    cucumbers and sausages, they just would not fit
    she tried them all.

    She finally learned to deep-throat after all
    Since she met Slick, she's really had a ball
    But Slick he's kinda lonesome
    With Susie and the kid
           D                    G
    'Cause though his dick just fits her throat
        A                D
    her pussy's much too big.
