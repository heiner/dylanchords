C                     F                   Csus4 C
What good am I if I'm like all the rest
     C                     F                 C      F C
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed
     Am                                  Em
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry
F    C    F  C
What good am I ?

What good am I if I know and don't do
If I see and don't say if I look right through you
If I turn a deaf ear to the thunderin' sky
What good am I ?

What good am I while you softly weep
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try
What good am I ?

     Am
What good am I then to others and me
                                 Em
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see
   Am                /d (n.c.)  Am
If my hands are tied must I not wonder within
                          Em                Dm
Who tied them and why and where must I have been.

<pre class="verse">
What good am I if I say foolish things
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
And I just turn my back while you silently die
What good am I ?
