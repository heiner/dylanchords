Ah, but what can I say…! This is the album that is responsible for my
addiction to Dylan (and not because I bought it when it was released).
It is not the one I play most regularly, but whenever I pick it out, I
ask myself why I don't do it more often.

Several of the songs are part of the daily routine, of course. Don't
Think Twice, Masters of War, Hard Rain, Girl of the North Country, not
to mention Blowin' in the Wind – I do believe I hear at least one of
these every day. Half an album of songs, almost 40 years old, by a then
folk singer, that still hold their ground in the repertory of a man who
has for 35 of those years been a rock artist – that's in itself a brand
of quality. And the rest of the songs ain't so bad either.

What this album first of all shows (and which was confirmed by <em>Good
As I Been To You</em>) is what an accomplished guitar player Dylan was –
and still is, when he wants to. There is some really nice guitar work on
some of these tracks: the finger-picking on [Don't Think Twice, It's All
Right](Don't Think Twice, It's All Right) and [Talkin' World
War III Blues](Talkin' World War III Blues), the
free-rhythmical blues a la Big Joe Williams of [Down the
Highway](Down the Highway), the lyricism of [Corrina,
Corrina](Corrina, Corrina), and the persistent, rhythmical
hammering-on of [Masters of War](Masters of War). None of it
is really (really) difficult – he gets as much effect as possible from
techniques that are actually quite simple (once you master them). This
is not to say that he's a cheater (those who have access to “[Hero
Blues](Hero Blues)”, an outtake from the
<em>Freewheelin'</em> sessions, can hear for themselves that Dylan anno
1963 had a quite good control of his instrument).

A contributing element is the use of [altered or open
tunings.](Help:Roadmaps#Open.2Falternate_tunings) Three of
the songs on <em>Freewheelin' </em>are in open D ([I Shall Be
Free](I Shall Be Free), [Corrina,
Corrina](Corrina, Corrina), and [Oxford
Town](Oxford Town)) and three in Dropped D tuning ([Masters
of War](Masters of War), [Down the
Highway](Down the Highway), and [A Hard Rain's A-Gonna
Fall](A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall)). Several of the outtakes
also use such tunings. It is noteworthy that the playing style in these
songs differs considerably from the style of the [\<em\>Blood on the
Tracks\</em\>](<em>Blood on the Tracks</em>) songs, which
were also originally played in open D tuning. It is said that it was
Joni Mitchell who inspired and/or taught him to use open D tuning, and
although he apparently knew it even ten years earlier, he didn't use the
same style and technique then.

A striking unifying feature of the playing style of
<em>Freewheelin'</em> is the many second-inversion chords, <em>i.e.</em>
chords with the fifth in the bass, such as D/a
(x<strong>0</strong>0232), which is so prominent in [Blowin' in the
Wind](Blowin' in the Wind). Another (I think related) feature
is the many ways he uses to avoid the dominant, such as the turn C –
Gadd4/b – G in [Blowin' in the Wind](Blowin' in the Wind) and
[Bob Dylan's Dream](Bob Dylan's Dream), about

which I intend to write a little piece some day.
