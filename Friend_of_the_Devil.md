    I lit out from Reno, I was trailed by twenty hounds
    G'     G/f#   C/e        G/d         C           C/b   Am
    Didn't get to sleep last night 'till the morning came around.

    D
     Set out runnin' but I take my time
      Am
    A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
       D
    If I get home before daylight,
      Am                  C       D
    I just might get some sleep tonight.

    Ran into the devil, babe, he loaned me twenty bills
    I spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills.

    Set out runnin' but I take my time,
    A friend of the devil is a friend of mine,
    If I get home before daylight,
    I just might get some sleep tonight.

    I ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there
    He took my twenty dollar bill and vanished in the air.

    Set out runnin' but I take my time
    A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
    If I get home before daylight,
    I just might get some sleep tonight.

    D
    Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night,
        Am
    The first one's named Sweet Anne Marie, and she's my hearts delight.
    D
    The second one is prison, babe, the sheriff's on my trail,
        Am                             C                D
    And if he catches up with me, I'll spend my life in jail.

    Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee
    The first one says she's got my child, but it don't look like me.

    Set out runnin' but I take my time,
    A friend of the devil is a friend of mine,
    If I get home before daylight,
    I just might get some sleep tonight.
