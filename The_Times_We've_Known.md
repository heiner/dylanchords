                    A
    The times we've known are slipping by
                F#m
    Iike vapour trails across the sky
                E
    The best of times, the worst of times
                  A     (Asus4 A)
    Have come and gone

    The years of debt, the years of doubt
    the years of 'what's it all about?'
    Of holding fast, and holding out
    And holding on

                  D                C#7
    When life was hard and chances few
                F#m
    Still I was rich in having you
                  B7
    Though people said we wouldn't go far
             E
    We went ahead and here we are

             A              /c#
    Together still remember me
             D
    Together still through everything
        A     E     A
    The times we've known

    Sometimes the years were lush and green
    Sometimes we lived on hope alone
    A little bit of both have been
    The times we've known

    Some lucky flings, some rotten breaks
    Some funny things, a few mistakes
    The dreams that every dreamer takes
    And makes his own

    The time to laugh, a time to cry
    A time to let the world go by
    And if there were some tears to pay
    No one can take those years away

    On fragile wings our days have flown
                  D                  D#dim
    Still we have things to call our own
        A     E     C#    F#
    The times we've known
        D     E6 E7 A
    The times we've known
