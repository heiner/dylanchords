<pre class="verse">
G                   Bm          C                G
If you had not have fallen then I would not have found you
C            D                G
Angel flying too close to the ground
G                 Bm              C         G
I patched up your broken wing and hung around for a while
          A                                   D      D7
trying to keep your spirits up and your fever down
</pre>

<pre class="refrain">
   G               G7
So leave me if you need to,
C            A
I will still remember
G            D                G
Angel flying too close to the ground.
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
  G                               C
I knew someday that you would fly away
A                                    D
for love's the greatest healer to be found
</pre>

<pre class="refrain">
So leave me if you need to,
I will still remember
Angel flying too close to the ground
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
Fly on fly on past the speed of sound
I'd rather see you up than see you down
</pre>

<pre class="refrain">
So leave me if you need to,
I will still remember
Angel flying too close to the ground.
</pre>
