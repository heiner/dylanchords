    G                   Bm          C                G
    If you had not have fallen then I would not have found you
    C            D                G
    Angel flying too close to the ground
    G                 Bm              C         G
    I patched up your broken wing and hung around for a while
              A                                   D      D7
    trying to keep your spirits up and your fever down

       G               G7
    So leave me if you need to,
    C            A
    I will still remember
    G            D                G
    Angel flying too close to the ground.

      G                               C
    I knew someday that you would fly away
    A                                    D
    for love's the greatest healer to be found

    So leave me if you need to,
    I will still remember
    Angel flying too close to the ground

    Fly on fly on past the speed of sound
    I'd rather see you up than see you down

    So leave me if you need to,
    I will still remember
    Angel flying too close to the ground.
