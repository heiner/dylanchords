Words and music Bob Dylan  
Recorded June 15, 1965 during the [Highway 61
Revisited](/wiki/Highway 61 Revisited "wikilink") sessions, released on [The
Bootleg Series 1-3](/wiki/The Bootleg Series 1-3 "wikilink") (1991)  
Tabbed by Eyolf Ã˜strem

Dylan is at the piano, hence the (black) key. A fair guess is that the
guitars are capoed on the fourth fret. That would give the chords E
(which is actually an E7-10 = 022133), B7 and A9 (x02000)

           Ab
    I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents

    I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents
                Eb7
    See my bull dog bite a rabbit
           Db9                                   Ab
    And my hound dog is sittin' on a barbed-wire fence

    Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot
    Yes, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot
    Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot
    But he wouldn't tell me what it was that I got

    Well, this woman I've got, she's killin' me alive
    Yes, this woman I've got, she's killin' me alive
    She's makin' me into an old man,
    and man I'm not even 25

    Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff
    I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
    Unless you've been inside a tunnel
    And fell down 69, 70 feet over a barbed-wire fence

    All right!
