    C                 E              Am           Cm6/eb
     Right now it may not seem like spring at all
          G                D            G
    We're drifting and the laughs are few
        C                    Bm
    But I've got plans for tomorrow
        Ddim     C         Cm6     G6   E7
    And all my tomorrows belong to you

    Am7                       D7      G
    All my bright tomorrows belong to you!

“Alright, alright! I want to tell you right now why we did that song.
There's a very special person around tonight. And it's her birthday
today, she wanted to hear that song.”

Additional verses, not sung by Dylan:

    1. Today I may not have a thing at all
    Except for just a dream or two
    But I've got lots of plans for tomorrow
    And all my tomorrows belong to you

    3. No one knows better than I
    That luck keeps passing me by ... that's fate
    But with you there at my side
    I'll soon be turning the tide ... just wait

    4. As long as I've got arms that cling at all
    It's you that I'll be clinging to
    And all the dreams I dream, beg, or borrow
    On some bright tomorrow they'll all come true
