<h1>Textual sources to the &quot;Love and Theft&quot; songs</h1>
<p>Submitted by Chris Johnson </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some phrases that Dylan apparently lifted from the English translation of Junichi Saga's <em>Confessions of a Yakuza</em> translated by John Bester) and used on Love and Theft: </p>

<p>Well, there you have it! It's a fascinating read in it's own right, and  
 obviously Dylan liked it. What more recommendation could you possibly  
 need?! It's available quite cheap in paperback from amazon.
