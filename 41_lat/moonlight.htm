<h1 class="songtitle">Moonlight</h1>


<p>Words and music Bob Dylan<br /> 
Released on <a class="recordlink" href="index.htm">Love And Theft</a> (2001)<br /> 
Tabbed by Eyolf &Oslash;strem</p>

<hr />


<p>Chords:</p>
<pre class="chords">
Bb6    x1303x                 C#o    x45353
Dm7-5  xx0111 or x5656x       Bb/d   x5333x
Cm7-5  x3434x                 C9     x35333
Dm/f   xx3231                 F+     x4322x
Bo     x23131
</pre>

<p>A more logical (or at least euphonious) progression at the end of the
intro and other places, would be Bb Bo Cm C#o. Bb/b matches what
Dylan sings... Euphony never was his middle name anyway.<br />
The Dm7 at &ldquo;meet me&rdquo; sounds like a Dm7-5 in some verses, but since
that clashes with the singing, I'd recommend a plain Dm7.<br />
The figure at the end of the bridge is transcribed according to what
is played. The chord names in the tab are more or less what results if
the bass and the song are considered; in the text I've suggested a
simpler version that does more or less the same (Dm/f - F+ - F7 -
F+).<br />
And remember: the bass notes that are played too early, which gives
the swing character.</p>

out in the moonlight alone

The dusky light the day is losing
Orchids, poppies, black-eyed susan
The earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone
Won't you meet me 
Cm7-5      Dm/f F    Bb     F+
out in the moonlight alone     

The air is thick and heavy
All along the levee
Where the geese into the countryside have flown
Won't you meet me 
Cm7-5      Dm/f  F    Bb   
out in the moonlight alone

The blessings of tranquility

Yet I know when the time is right to strike

I take you 'cross the river, dear

<pre class="verse">
The clouds are turning crimson
The leaves fall from the limbs and
The branches cast their shadows over stone
Won't you meet me 
out in the moonlight alone

The boulevards of cypress trees
The masquerade of birds and bees
The petals pink and white, the wind has blown
Won't you meet me 
out in the moonlight alone
</pre>

<pre class="bridge">
The trailing moss in mystic glow
The purple blossom soft as snow
My tears keep flowing to the sea.
Doctor, lawyer, Indian chief
It takes a thief to catch a thief
For whom does the bell toll for, love?
It tolls for you and me.  *)
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
Old pulses running through my palm
The sharp hills are rising from
Yellow fields with twisted oaks that groan
Won't you meet me 
out in the moonlight alone
