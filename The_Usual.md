    A
    I'm trippin over dumb drunks at a party
    F                      G                 A
    My girlfriend just ran off with the DJ
    A
    I'd give her everything I had, but she refused it
    F                        G                         A
    It don't matter now, she don't know how to use it
    C
    My confidence is dwindling
    D
    Look at the shape I'm in
    C
    Where's my pearls, where's the swine?

    D                                           [n.c.]
    I'm not thirsty, but I'm standing in line.
                        A
    I'll have the usual

    Yeah, I'll have the usual

    Fifty silhouettes now tumblin' on the dance floor
    Pink elephants fallin' through a trap door
    Sixty cigarettes a day because I'm nervous
    When will that bitch begin to serve us?
    I used to be a good boy, livin' the good life
    Fifty thousand kisses later she was a housewife
    She was good, I was unkind

    I'm not thirsty, but I'm standin' in line
    I'll have the usual, yeah
    I'll have the usual

    Big Jim says that the second comin's comin'
    I think he must be seein' double or something
    You can hang around here, waiting for the offerings
    I can't win, but I've seen enough, man
    A fifth of whisky keep the doctor away
    A little more and it's judgment day
    I had a future, but she just passed out

    I'm gonna drink until I see what am I talkin' about
    I'll have the usual, yeah
    I'll have the usual
    I'll have the usual
    Yeah, the usual
