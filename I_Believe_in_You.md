    E

    E
    They ask me how I feel

    And if my love is real
                        A       E
    And how I know I'll make it through.
        E
    And they, they look at me and frown,
                                      D
    They'd like to drive me from this town,
                        A
    They don't want me around
               E
    'Cause I believe in you.

    They show me to the door,
    They say don't come back no more
    'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to,
    And I walk out on my own
    A thousand miles from home
    But I don't feel alone
    'Cause I believe in you.

        D            A                              E
    I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
        D            A                  E
    I believe in you even though we be apart.
        D            A                   E
    I believe in you even on the morning after.
    A            B    E  E  A
    Oh, when the dawn is nearing
    A            B        E    E  A
    Oh, when the night is disappearing
    A        B   E      E    A           B
    Oh, this feeling is still here in my heart.

    Don't let me drift too far,
    Keep me where you are
    Where I will always be renewed.
    And that which you've given me today
    Is worth more than I could pay
    And no matter what they say
    I believe in you.

    I believe in you when winter turn to summer,
    I believe in you when white turn to black,
    I believe in you even though I be outnumbered.
    Oh, though the earth may shake me
    Oh, though my friends forsake me
    Oh, even that couldn't make me go back.

    Don't let me change my heart,
    Keep me set apart
    From all the plans they do pursue.
    And I, I don't mind the pain
    Don't mind the driving rain
    I know I will sustain
    'Cause I believe in you.
