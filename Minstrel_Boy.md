Portrait](Self Portrait "wikilink") (1970)  
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

The chords in the chorus are approximations only; the last line could be
played with F - Em - Dm - C as well.  
The lyrics are the official ones – I didn't see any reason to change
them to whatever he sings live.

    C                      F6       G11   C
    Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin?
                F      C
    Who's gonna let it roll?
    C           Em         F6       G11   C
    Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin?
                F           C       G7       C
    Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?

        F       C         F          C
    Oh, Lucky's drivin' a long, long time
        F        C        G
    And now he's stuck on top of the hill.
    F                   C           F                C
    With twelve forward gears, it's been a long hard climb,
             F           C                    G
    And with all of them ladies, though, he's lonely still.

    Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin?
    Who's gonna let it roll?
    Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin?
    Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?

    Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
    Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load.
    Beneath his bound'ries, what more can I tell,
    With all of his trav'lin', but I'm still on that road.

    Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin?
    Who's gonna let it roll?
    Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin?
    Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
