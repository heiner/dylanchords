Written by Tim Hardin (1967)  
Performed by Bob Dylan in 1992 (once) and 1994 (three times)  
Tabbed by Eyolf Ã˜strem (based on the version from Apr 13 1994)

Capo 1st fret (sounding key C\# major), or a fast tape.

The G at the beginning of the chorus is tinted with a c, i.e. it could
basically be played as a Gsus4 (e.g. 320013), although it may also be
the outcome of two different chords (C and G) being played on two
different guitars.

    C              G
    Lady came from Baltimore,
    F                C
    All she wore was lace.
    F                    C
     She never knew that I was poor,
    G(sus4       G)
    never saw my face.

    Am             G
    I was there to take her money,
    F                   C
    Steal her rings and run.
    F              C
    Then I fell in love
             G                   C
    with the lady, got away with none.

    [1 verse/refrain interlude]

    The lady's name was Susan Moore,
    Her daddy read the law.
    She never knew that I was poor,
    And lived outside the law.

    Her daddy said, I was a thief
    Never married her for love.
    It was Susan's true belief
    I married her for love.

    I was there to take her money,
    Steal her rings and run.
    Then I fell in love
    with the lady,  got away with none.

    [1 verse/refrain interlude]

    Outside her house there was a wall
    To keep the robbers out.
    She'd never stop to think at all
    If that's what I'm about.

    I was there to take her money,
    Steal her rings and run.
    Then I fell in love
    with the lady, got away with none.
