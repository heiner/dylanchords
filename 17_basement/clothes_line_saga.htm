After a while we took in the clothes,

Nobody said very much.

Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants

Which nobody really wanted to touch.

Mama come in and picked up a book

An' Papa asked her what it was.
C
Someone else asked, &quot;What do you care?&quot;

Papa said, &quot;Well, just because.&quot;
G7          
Then they started to take back their clothes,

Hang 'em on the line.
       C
It was January the thirtieth

And everybody was feelin' fine.

The very next day everybody got up
Seein' if the clothes were dry.
The dogs were barking, a neighbor passed,
Mama, of course, she said, &quot;Hi!&quot;
&quot;Have you heard the news?&quot; he said, with a grin,
&quot;The Vice-President's gone mad!&quot;
&quot;Where?&quot; &quot;Downtown.&quot; &quot;When?&quot; &quot;Last night.&quot;
&quot;Hmm, say, that's too bad!&quot;
&quot;Well, there's nothin' we can do about it,&quot; said the neighbor,
&quot;It's just somethin' we're gonna have to forget.&quot;
&quot;Yes, I guess so,&quot; said Ma,
Then she asked me if the clothes was still wet.

I reached up, touched my shirt,
And the neighbor said, &quot;Are those clothes yours?&quot;
I said, &quot;Some of 'em, not all of 'em.&quot;
He said, &quot;Ya always help out around here with the chores?&quot;
I said, &quot;Sometime, not all the time.&quot;
Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
Just as papa yelled outside,
&quot;Mama wants you t' come back in the house and bring them clothes.&quot;
Well, I just do what I'm told,
So, I did it, of course.
I went back in the house and Mama met me
And then I shut all the doors.
