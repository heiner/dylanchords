<pre class="verse">
       G       Am      Bm       Am     G      Am Bm Am
[it's] alright in my head, but I can't slumber
        G            Am    Bm       Am            G     Am Bm 
and its too high for me to count, I can't get the number
Am             G   Am Bm 
I'm a fool for you
    Am             G   Am Bm Am
yes I'm a fool for you

Well, you hear my celebrate, oh its story
but they're all too vain for me, all they want is glory
I'm a fool for you
I'm a fool for you
</pre>

<pre class="refrain">
         C                             G
well its lonely in my days how can I believe
        C                                 D
and its all in my heart but I just can't receive, yeah hear me now

<pre class="verse">
It's crazy down in love ridin' all around

yeah the heart shall rise, everybody shall burn
