<h1 class="songtitle">I'm Your Teenage Prayer</h1>


<p>Words and music Bob Dylan (I presume)<br /> 
Sung (if that's what it's called) by Dylan and the Band in the
Basement, 1967<br />
Tabbed and transcribed by Eyolf &Oslash;strem</p>

<p>Capo 2nd fret (sounding key D major)</p>

<p>Words in parentheses ( ) are the mostly spoken interjections of the
Band (is it Richard Manuel?).<br />
Words in brackets [ ] are Dylan's spoken words.<br />
I haven't written out the laughter, because it's all over the place.</p>
