D
Old man sailin' in a dinghy boat Down there

Old man down is baitin' a hook On there
      D              
Gonna pull man down on a suckling hook
      G                                     D      A     D
Gonna pull man into the suckling brook*) Oh yeah!

Now, he's underneath that apple  suckling tree, Oh yeah!
Under that apple suckling tree, Oh yeah!
That's underneath that tree
There's just gonna be you and me
Underneath that apple suckling tree, Oh yeah!

I push him back and I stand in line, Oh yeah!
Then I push my lady and stand in line, Oh yeah!
Then I push my lady and stand in line
I get on board like a two-eyed time, Oh yeah!

Under that apple suckling tree, Oh yeah!
Under that apple suckling tree, Oh yeah!
Underneath that tree
There's just gonna be you and me
Underneath that apple suckling tree, Oh yeah!

Now, who should I tell and who's to tell me? Oh yeah!
Who's on the table, who's to tell me? Oh yeah!
Who should I tell, oh, who should I tell?
The forty-nine in your burning hell
Oh underneath that old apple suckling tree

Under that apple suckling tree, Oh yeah!
Under that apple suckling tree, Oh yeah!
Underneath that tree
There's just gonna be you and me
Underneath that apple suckling tree, Oh yeah!

<p>*) Official lyrics. Dylan seems to sing something like: &ldquo;there's
other place he ought to pay [...] brook, oh yeah&rdquo;</p>

Pull him down in a county hook, my man.

Now I wish to my soul I had seven years, Oh yeah!
