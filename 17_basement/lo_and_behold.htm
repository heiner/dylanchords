A
I pulled out for San Anton',
  D
I never felt so good.
   A
My woman said she'd meet me there
       D
And of course, I knew she would.
    A
The coachman, he hit me for my hook
       D
And he asked me my name.
  A
I give it to him right away,
      D       
And I hung my head in shame.
A
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
D
Lookin' for my lo and behold,
C      G          A
Get me outa here, my dear man!


I come into Pittsburgh
At six-thirty flat.
I found myself a vacant seat
An' I put down my hat.
&quot;What's the matter, Molly, dear,
What's the matter with your mound?&quot;
&quot;What's it to ya, Moby Dick?
This is chicken town!&quot;
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
Lookin' for my lo and behold,
Get me outa here, my dear man!

I bought myself a herd of moose,
One day she could call her own.*)
Well, she came out the very next day
To see where they had flown.
I'm goin' down to Tennessee,
Get me a truck 'r somethin'.
Gonna save my money and rip it up!
- - -
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
Lookin' for my lo and behold,
Get me outa here, my dear man!

Now, I come in on a ferris wheel
An' boys, I sure was slick.
I come in like a ton of bricks,
Laid a few tricks on 'em.
Goin' back to Pittsburgh,
Count up to thirty,
Round that horn and ride that herd,
Gonna thread up!**)
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
Lookin' for my lo and behold,
Get me outa here, my dear man!

Now, I come in on a ferris wheel 
An' boys, I sure was slick. 
I moved in like a tornado,  
and I also laid a few tricks on 'em. 
Movin' on out, I'm goin' to Pittsburgh again, 
Ridin' round that herd right for home,
We're all gonna go to sleep
