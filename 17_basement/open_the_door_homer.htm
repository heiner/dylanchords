<pre class="verse">
G

               G
Now, there's a certain thing
       Em
That I learned from Jim
G                                   D
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
    G
And that is that there's a certain way
Em  
 we all must swim
        C
If we expect to live off
                  D
Of the fat of the land.
</pre>

<pre class="refrain">
         Am
Open the door, Rachel [Richard?],

I've heard it said before.

Open the door, Rachel,

I've heard it said before
      C                           G
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
Now, there's a certain thing
That I learned from my friend, Mouse
A fella who never blushes
And that is that one must always
flush out his house
If he don't expect to be housing flushes.

Chorus

<pre class="verse">
&quot;Take care of all your memories&quot;
Said Mick
&quot;For you cannot relive them
And remember when you're out there
Tryin' to heal the sick
That you must always
First forgive them.&quot;
