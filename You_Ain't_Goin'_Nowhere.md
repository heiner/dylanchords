    G
    Clouds so swift
    Am
    Rain won't lift
    C
    Gate won't close
    G
    Railings froze
    G                 Am
    Get your mind off wintertime
    C                 G
    You ain't goin' nowhere

    G        Am
    Whoo-ee! Ride me high
      C
    Tomorrow's the day
       G
    My bride's gonna come
    G           Am
    Oh, oh, are we gonna fly
    C                G
    Down in the easy chair!

    I don't care
    How many letters they sent
    Morning came and morning went
    Pick up your money
    And pack up your tent
    You ain't goin' nowhere

    Whoo-ee! Ride me high
    Tomorrow's the day
    My bride's gonna come
    Oh, oh, are we gonna fly
    Down in the easy chair!

    Buy me a flute
    And a gun that shoots
    Tailgates and substitutes
    Strap yourself
    To the tree with roots
    You ain't goin' nowhere

    Whoo-ee! Ride me high
    Tomorrow's the day
    My bride's gonna come
    Oh, oh, are we gonna fly
    Down in the easy chair!

    Genghis Khan
    He could not keep
    All his kings
    Supplied with sleep
    We'll climb that hill no matter how steep
    When we get up to it

    Whoo-ee! Ride me high
    Tomorrow's the day
    My bride's gonna come
    Oh, oh, are we gonna fly
    Down in the easy chair!

Capo 2nd fret (sounding key A major)  
Chords as above

    Now look here dear Sue
    You best feed the cat
    The cat needs feedin'
    You're the one to do it
    Get your hat
    Feed the cat
    You ain't goin' nowhere

    Whoo-ee! Ride me high
    Tomorrow's the day
    My bride's gonna come
    Oh, oh, are we gonna fly
    Down in the easy chair!

    Look here you bunch of
    basement noise
    You ain't no
    punchin' bag
    I see you walkin' out there,
    and you're the one to do it
    Pick up your nose, you canary
    You ain't goin' nowhere

    Just pick up that oil cloth
    cram it in the corner
    I don't care if your name is Michael,
    you gonna need some boards
    Get your lunch
    you foreign bib
    You ain't goin' nowhere

    Now look here, you pile of money,
    you best go off here to find a file
    I've seen you out there beatin' on you hammer,
    you ain't no head lettuce
    Beat that buzzard
    lay 'm on the rug
    You ain't goin' nowhere

Chords as above

    Clouds so swift an' rain fallin' in
    Gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din"
    Pack up your money, pull up your tent McGuinn
    You ain't goin' nowhere.

    Whoo-ee, ride me high
    Tomorrow's the day
    That my bride's a-gonna come
    Whoo-ee, are we gonna fly
    Down into the easy chair.

    Genghis Khan an' his brother Don
    Could not keep on keepin' on
    We'll climb that bridge after it's gone
    After we're way past it.

    Buy me some rings an' a gun that sings
    A flute that toots an' a bee that stings
    A sky that cries an' a bird that flies
    A fish that walks an' a dog that talks.
