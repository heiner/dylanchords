        <h2>Introductory notes </h2>
        <h3>Eyolf Østrem</h3>
Ah, but what can I say…! This is the
album that is responsible for my addiction to Dylan (and not
because I bought it when it was released). It is not the one I play
most regularly, but whenever I pick it out, I ask myself why I
don’t do it more often.

Several of the songs are part
of the daily routine, of course. Don’t Think Twice, Masters
of War, Hard Rain, Girl of the North Country, not to mention
Blowin’ in the Wind – I do believe I hear at least one of
these every day. Half an album of songs, almost 40 years old, by a
then folk singer, that still hold their ground in the repertory of
a man who has for 35 of those years been a rock artist –
that’s in itself a brand of quality.  And the rest of the
songs ain’t so bad either.

What this album first of all shows (and which was confirmed by
<em>Good As I Been To You</em>) is what an accomplished guitar
player Dylan was – and still is, when he wants to. There is some
really nice guitar work on some of these tracks: the finger-picking
on [[Don't Think Twice, It's All Right]] and
[[Talkin' World War III Blues]], the free-rhythmical blues a la Big Joe Williams of
[[Down the Highway]], the lyricism
of [[Corrina, Corrina]], and the
persistent, rhythmical hammering-on of [[Masters of War]]. None of it is
really (really) difficult – he gets as much effect as possible from
techniques that are actually quite simple (once you master them).
This is not to say that he’s a cheater (those who have access
to  “[[Hero Blues]]”, an outtake from the
<em>Freewheelin’</em> sessions, can hear for themselves that
Dylan anno 1963 had a quite good control of his instrument).

A contributing element is the use of [[Help:Roadmaps#Open.2Falternate_tunings|altered or open tunings.]] Three of
the songs on <em>Freewheelin’ </em>are in open D ([[I Shall Be Free]], [[Corrina, Corrina]], and [[Oxford Town]]) and three in Dropped D
tuning ([[Masters of War]], [[Down the Highway]], and [[A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall]]). Several of the outtakes
also use such tunings. It is noteworthy that the playing style in
these songs differs considerably from the style of the [[<em>Blood on the Tracks</em>]]
songs, which were also originally played in open D tuning. It is
said that it was Joni Mitchell who inspired and/or taught him to
use open D tuning, and although he apparently knew it even ten
years earlier, he didn’t use the same style and technique
then.

A striking unifying feature of the playing style of
<em>Freewheelin’</em> is the many second-inversion chords,
<em>i.e.</em> chords with the fifth in the bass, such as D/a
(x<strong>0</strong>0232), which is so prominent in [[Blowin' in the Wind]].
Another (I think related) feature is the many ways he uses to avoid
the dominant, such as the turn C – Gadd4/b – G in [[Blowin' in the Wind]] and
[[Bob Dylan's Dream]], about

which I intend to write a little piece some day.
