            Bb
    Well, I looked as far as I could see, baby
                                    F
    I looked as far as I could see, baby
            Bb
    Well, I looked as far as I could see,
    Eb
    All mankind in misery,
    Bb    F               Bb
    Baby, won't you be my baby?

    Well, I looked east, I looked west, baby
    I looked east, I looked west, baby
    Well, I looked east, I looked west
    There was nothing I could see that I liked the best
    Baby, won't you be my baby?

    [Go down the land], drop your heavy load, baby
    Go down the land, drop your load, baby
    Go down the land, drop your load,
    Just don't look back, it's a dead end road
    Baby, won't you be my baby?

    Now east and west the fire will rise, baby
    east and west the fire will rise, baby
    east and west the fire will rise
    Shut your mouth, close your eyes,
    Baby, won't you be my baby?

    Oh, [I been off] savin' your time, baby
    I ain't tryin' to mess, I'll just save your time, baby
    I ain't tryin' to mess, just save your time,
    but it's your life, it's not mine
    Baby, won't you be my baby?
