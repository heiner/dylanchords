## Introductory Remarks

### Eyolf Østrem

The question is not so much: “Is this a good Dylan album?” – which it is
– as “Is this a Dylan album?” – which it isn't.

First the lyrics: as Scott Warmuth has discovered, through an ingenious
google investigation, [several lines of lyrics are
lifted](http://dylanchords.info/45_modern/timrod.html) from the works of
the “Poet Laureate of the Confederacy” Henry Timrod in much the same way
as Yunichi Saga's *Confessions of a Yakuza* [unwittingly
contributed](http://dylanchords.info/41_lat/textual_sources.htm) to
*“Love and Theft”*. This has caused considerable reactions, in
far wider circles than usual.

So, is Dylan a thieving scoundrel and a plagiarist, or a genius who
transforms what he reads into new gems?

The lyrical side of his creative borrowings don't bother me a single
bit, and I'm surprised that such a fuss has been made over this. If
anything, they add to the value of Dylan's effort, rather than subtract
from it. I would never call any of that *plagiarism*, neither in
the case of *Modern Times* nor of *“Love and Theft”*. I
can't imagine Dylan sitting there in his divine solitude, struggling
with a line, then walking over to the bookshelf and picking out Timrod
or Saga in search for a line that would work. Now, *that* would
have come closer to plagiarism: to let someone else do the job. I
imagine it's the other way around: Dylan has read Yakuza and Timrod,
certain phrases and figures have stuck in his mind, from where they in
due time have popped up again, in a completely new context. This kind of
use is not dictated by need but by circumstance, coincidence,
“intuition” if you wish. That is what I find fascinating about the use
of these sources on these two albums: they highlight just how it is that
things “pop up” in one's mind – how people think.

But my surprise by the overreaction regarding a few creatively
transformed word connections is multiplied by the lack of a similar
reaction to the musical borrowings. These are both much more substantial
and much more difficult to defend.

At the time of writing (Wed 20 Sept, 16:08 CET), the following songs on
*Modern Times* have known models for their music (for the textual
borrowings from Henry Timrod, see the link above. Note also that there
are numerous borrowings from sources other than Timrod; see
[<http://www.republika.pl/bobdylan/>](http://www.republika.pl/bobdylan/)):

-   <strong>Rollin' and Tumblin'</strong> • Taken from Muddy Water's
    version of Hambone Willie Newbern's “Roll and Tumble Blues” from
    1929.
-   <strong>When the Deal Goes Down</strong> • based on Bing Crosby's
    trademark song “Where the Blue of the Night (Meets the Gold of the
    Day)” by Roy Turk and Fred E. Ahlert
-   <strong>Beyond the Horizon</strong> • Taken from Jim Kennedy's “Red
    Sails in the Sunset”
-   <strong>The Levee's Gonna Break</strong> • taken wholesale (apart
    from a few new lines of lyrics here and there) from Kansas Joe &
    Memphis Minnie's “When the Levee Breaks” from 1929.
-   <strong>Someday Baby</strong> • taken from “Worried Life Blues” (aka
    “Someday Baby” or “Trouble No More”), performed by Sleepy John
    Estes, Fred McDowell, Lightnin' Hopkins, Muddy Waters, Chuck Berry,
    Eric Clapton, the Animals, and Bob Dylan himself (Toad's Place,
    1990), just to mention a few.

These are not just influences: in all cases, the chord structure is
lifted from the models and the melody is clearly recognizable, and in
some cases, the whole arrangement is “borrowed”.

That's five out of ten. Furthermore, I'd be very surprised if the music
to *Spirit on the Water* is Dylan's own. Thunder on the Mountain
could be by anyone, and probably is. That leaves us with three songs
where the music is – at least until proven otherwise – truly “by Bob
Dylan”.

It so happens that these are the three strongest songs on the album:
“Nettie Moore”, “Ain't Talkin'” and “Workingman's Blues \#2”. [note:
Nettie Moore is a borderline case; the refrain is vaguely similar to
“Gentle Nettie Moore” [<a href="../others/gentle-nettie-moore.pdf">pdf
file</a>], a song printed in the 1860, but the differences are also
substantial.] I don't know if this is good news or bad: it is reassuring
that his own songs are the best, but why, then, did he have to put in
the rest of it – didn't he have more than three songs in him in five
years?

If this is a sign of creative drought, that may be a matter of concern
regarding the possibility of more albums in the future, but in
*this* particular context, it's not my main concern.

If the various textual allusions and citations can be redeemed as a
fascinating display of creative intertextual intution, it is quite the
opposite with the music. When Dylan w/band play the exact same notes and
the exact same solos as Muddy Waters did on “Rollin' and Tumblin'”,
that's not “intuition” or creative translocation, it's just “letting
Muddy do the job”, plain and simple. That doesn't add to my appreciation
of the work – on the contrary.

Not all the borrowings are as straightforward as “Rollin' and Tumblin'”.
“When the Deal Goes Down” is a more interesting case. It is based on
Bing Crosby's “Where the Blue of the Night (Meets the Gold of the Day)”,
and Dylan has in fact been open or semi-open about this. In a Live Talk
with David Gates, who interviewed Dylan for Newsweek after
*Chronicles* came out, Gates answered questions from the
audience. One of them was:

> Did Bob share any details with you regarding the songs for his next album? What's the scoop?

And the answer was:

> David Gates: Really only that he's working on them. he did say he's written a song based on the melody from a Bing Crosby song, “Where the Blue of the Night (Meets the Gold of the Day).” How much it'll actually sound like that is anybody's guess. [From [[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6099027/site/newsweek/](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6099027/site/newsweek/)](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6099027/site/newsweek/). Thanks to Jörgen Lindström for directing my attention to this.]

We now know the answer to the last question: Not much, actually.
Although the song structure and he chords are identical, the phrasing,
the melody line, and the pace in Dylan's version are all very different
from Crosby's slow, insinuating crooning. It is indeed “a song based on
the melody” from “Where the Blue of the Night” rather than “Where the
Blue of the Night” with new lyrics.

The case is quite analogous to Dylan's version of “You Belong To Me” --
or just about every live cover he has performed during the Never Ending
Tour years: his melody differs considerably from the original; he has
definitely made it his own, although the underlying tune is clearly the
same. The difference is that “You Belong To Me” doesn't have “Written by
Bob Dylan” under it

Putting the label “All songs written by Bob Dylan” on this CD is plain
indecency. Again, this applies only to the music; I would *not*
have wished to see anyhing like: “Words by Bob Dylan and Henry Timrod”.
But I *would* have liked to see: “Words: Bob Dylan, Music: Muddy
Waters” (disregarding here the fact that Muddy didn't write the tune
either, but that's moot: *he* played those solos, *he*
shaped the song into the form which Dylan has taken over, so for all
intents and purposes Muddy is the originator). If Dylan has copyrighted
the tunes of Rollin' and Tumblin' and Beyond the Horizon, he gets money
from selling something he didn't own in the first place. And regardless
of the money, by putting “by Bob Dylan” under it he is taking creative
credit for something he didn't create, stating “This is what I have to
say” without actually saying anything. *That's* my main concern:
he isn't saying anything. And as Tom Lehrer so eloquently put it: “If
you can't communicate, the least you can do is *shut up*!”

As more and more references and borrowings were discovered on *“Love
and Theft”*, I got this wonderful vision: what if it wasn't just a
few lines of Japanese gangster-lore here and there – what if
*every* note and *every* lyric line were direct
quotations, put together in a grand collage – *that* would have
been a major achievement, and a bold highlighting of the problematic of
communication, by blurring the normally well-established pattern of
sender-receiver; pointing (fingers) to our expectations and norms, and
proving them to be wrong. It would have been like a game. And that title
… But when the same thing happens on *Modern Times*, only without
the extra level of “game”, it just becomes a sign of someone who is
content with playing lounge music, but who has a reputation to live up
to and a record company with an over-zealous sales department on his
back.

Some have defended Dylan with reference to the folk tradition. “This is
what one does there: one takes what one hears and builds on that. This
is what Dylan has always done.” Etc. Fair enough, but only to a point.
Of course, there are contexts where, for historical or other reasons, a
legalistic approach to authorship may be less relevant than in other
contexts, or at least require an interpretation in the light of
practice, the “folk tradition” being one such context. The next question
would then be if a multi-million seller is at all comparable to the
swapping, sharing, reworking of songs in coffee-houses or dance halls
which I would more immediately associate with the “folk tradition”. If
the folk tradition is about community, sharing, and freedom of
expression, *Modern Times* does that, but it does a lot of other
things too, such as making money for the artist, the record company, and
the manager's uncle, which places it in a completely different context.

Besides, as [Nick Manho](http://nickmanho.blogspot.com) said on the
dylanpool (making a point that he had borrowed/stolen from emily smith):

> The difference between Bob ripping off the blues guys in the 60s and Bob
> ripping off the blues guys now is that *in the 60s Bob's rip-offs
> were better than the originals*.

There's a point in that. Not that quality would be a justification for
rip-offs, nor that the statement is *always* true, taken
literally, but to the extent that standing in a creative tradition would
imply taking in something from a common storehouse (whether or not an
original composer can be identified), processing it, and putting out
something which adds something to the input. The point of standing on
others' shoulders should be to see farther, not to stand taller. 'Being
in the folk tradition' isn't a valid excuse for acting more like a
thieving bastard than as a creative musician with a rich heritage.
