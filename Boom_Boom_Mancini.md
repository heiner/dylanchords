Capo 1st fret

    G5    355xxx or xx00xx  (or play a straight Em with a G in the
    E5    022xxx             bass for the first beats in the riff)
    D9    xx0210 or x54530

    G5    E5         G5    E5
    Hurry home early hurry on home
    C            G               F#m      E5
    Boom Boom Mancini's fighting Bobby Chacon
    Hurry home early hurry on home
    Boom Boom Mancini's fighting Bobby Chacon

         G5    E5               G5   E5
    From Youngstown, Ohio, Ray "Boom Boom" Mancini
      G              D            G      D    E5
    A lightweight contender, like father like son
    He fought for the title with Frias in Vegas
    And he put him away in round number one

    Hurry home early hurry on home
    Boom Boom Mancini's fighting Bobby Chacon x2

    When Alexis Arguello gave Boom Boom a beating
    Seven weeks later he was back in the ring
    Some have the speed and the right combinations
    If you can't take the punches, it don't mean a thing

    Hurry home early hurry on home
    Boom Boom Mancini's fighting Bobby Chacon x2

              G
    When they asked him who was responsible
            D
    For the death of Du Koo Kim
              C
    He said, "Some one should have stopped the fight
        D9             E
    And told me it was him."

    They made hypocrite judgements after the fact
    But the name of the game is be hit and hit back

    Hurry home early hurry on home
    Boom Boom Mancini's fighting Bobby Chacon
    Hurry home early hurry on home
    Boom Boom Mancini's fighting Bobby Chacon

Dylan's version

</h2>
Some of the harmonic finesses lack – this is a more straightforward Em
blues of some kind. Some minor lyric changes, some of which may even be
conscious.

Capo 3rd fret
