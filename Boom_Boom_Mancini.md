     G5    E5               G5   E5
From Youngstown, Ohio, Ray "Boom Boom" Mancini
  G              D            G      D    E5
A lightweight contender, like father like son
He fought for the title with Frias in Vegas
And he put him away in round number one

When Alexis Arguello gave Boom Boom a beating
Seven weeks later he was back in the ring
Some have the speed and the right combinations
If you can't take the punches, it don't mean a thing

Hurry home early hurry on home
Boom Boom Mancini's fighting Bobby Chacon x2

<pre class="bridge2">
          G
When they asked him who was responsible
        D
For the death of Du Koo Kim

He said, "Some one should have stopped the fight
    D9             E
And told me it was him."

<pre class="verse">
They made hypocrite judgements after the fact
But the name of the game is be hit and hit back

Hurry home early hurry on home
Boom Boom Mancini's fighting Bobby Chacon
Hurry home early hurry on home
Boom Boom Mancini's fighting Bobby Chacon

<h2 class="songversion">Dylan's version</h2>

Some of the harmonic finesses lack – this is a more straightforward Em
blues of some kind. Some minor lyric changes, some of which may even
be conscious.

Capo 3rd fret
