Are you ready 
        G      C Bb     G     C Bb 
Are you ready

Are you ready

Are you ready

Are you ready to meet Jesus? 

Are you where you ought to be? 

Will He know you when He sees you 

Or will He say, &quot;Depart from Me&quot;? 
        G      C Bb     G     C Bb 
Are you ready, 
            G      C Bb     G     C Bb 
hope you're ready. 


Am I ready? 
am I ready? 
Am I ready? 
am I ready? 
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren 
And to take up my cross? 
Have I surrendered to the will of God 
Or am I still acting like the boss? 
Am I ready, hope I'm ready. 

When destruction cometh swiftly 
And there's no time to say a fare-thee-well, 
Have you decided whether you want to be 
In heaven or in hell? 
Are you ready? Are you ready? 

Have you got some unfinished business? 
Is there something holding you back? 
Are you thinking for yourself 
Or are you following the pack? 

Are you ready for the judgment? 
Are you ready for that terrible swift sword? 
Are you ready for Armageddon? 
Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
