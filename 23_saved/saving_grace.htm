<pre class="verse">
C              C/7     F            G     C
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven? 
C       C/B       Am           C/G   F  Bb  F     
Guess I owe You some kind of apology. 
/F /G  Ab                                         C
I've escaped death so many times, I know I'm only living 
              G                 C
By the saving grace that's over me. 

By this time I'd-a thought I would be sleeping 
In a pine box for all eternity. 
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping 
For the saving grace that's over me. 

Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection, 
Wherever I am welcome is where I'll be. 
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection 
Is the saving grace that's over me. 

Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding, 
But to search for love, that ain't no more than vanity. 
As I look around this world all that I'm finding 
Is the saving grace that's over me. 

The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it, 
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary. 
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it 
By the saving grace that's over me.
