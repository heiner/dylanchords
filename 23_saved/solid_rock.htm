          C   D   A
Well, I'm hangin' on
     C D   A
to a solid rock
D E F#m
Made
D E F#m
before
    D E F#m
the foundation
D E F#m
of
    A
the world
      D
And I won't let go, and I can't let go, won't let go
                                                        A
And I can't let go, won't let go, and I can't let go no more.

     C  D      A              C  D      A
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
     C     D     A           E
For me he was rejected by a world that He created.
C  D        A      C      D   A
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
C      D      A        E
People are expecting a false peace to come.

          G       A
Well I'm hangin' on ...

It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it
Using all the devices under the sun.
And He never give up 'til the battle's lost or won.
