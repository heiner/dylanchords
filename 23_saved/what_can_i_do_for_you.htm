<h1 class="songtitle">What Can I Do For You?</h1>
<p>Words and Music by Bob Dylan<br />
  Released on <a class="recordlink" href="index.htm">Saved</a> (1980)<br />
  Tabbed by Eyolf &Oslash;strem</p>
<hr />
<p>Capo 3rd fret (original key Eb major).</p>
<p>I have for some reason transcribed the final harp solo. You can find it <a href="whatcan_harp_solo.htm" target="_blank">here. 
</a>(Eb harp, straight. The transcription is in C major). It is far from optimized for screen viewing, not at all, but you can save the image and print it out if/when you want to recreate Dylan's most glorious moment as a harpist. <br />
	.[There's also a <a class="url" href="http://www.dylanchords.com/23_saved/WHATCAN.mid">midi file</a>, not to listen to, but to insert into the program &ldquo;Harping&rdquo; (if you use Windows), which you can download from <a class="url" href="http://www.freeyellow.com/members6/harping/">http://www.freeyellow.com/members6/harping/</a>.</p>

C   Am   F                   G
You have given everything to me. 
           F  F/g  C
What can I do for You? 
C   Am   F                G
You have given me eyes to see.  
           F  F/g  C
What can I do for You?

Am               C/g             F               C/e
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside, 
Am          G               C           Dm
Filled up a hunger that had always been denied, 
Am                  C/g                  F         C/e   Dm
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide 
           Am           C/g          F
And You've chosen me to be among the few.  
                  C
What can I do for You?

You have laid down Your life for me. 
What can I do for You? 
You have explained every mystery. 
What can I do for You?

Soon as a man is born, you know the sparks begin to fly, 
He gets wise in his own eyes and he's made to believe a lie. 
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die? 
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do. 
What can I do for You?

You have given all there is to give. 
What can I do for You? 
You have given me life to live. 
How can I live for You?

I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts, 
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts, 
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart. 
Well, I don't deserve it but I sure did make it through. 
What can I do for You?
