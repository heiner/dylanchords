Words and music by Bob Dylan  
Released on [Time out of Mind](/wiki/Time out of Mind "wikilink") (1997)  
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

This is a piano tune on the record, but harmonically it is an almost
exact copy of “Simple twist of fate”, and can preferably be played on
guitar in open tuning (E or D), with the chords 054000, 044000, 034000,
020120, xx5450, 000000, 222222 (or even better 020220), x02100, 000000
for the verse and 021020, 000000, 010010, 021020, 000000, 021020,
000000, 222120, x02102 (or -00 or -20), 000000 for the bridge. Got
that...?

In standard tuning it is most easily played using G as tonic, but I give
it here in C, as that is closest to the key of the recording. Capo 1st
fret (Original key Db major).

    C     x32010
    G/b   x20003 (could even be played as an Em/B:x22000)
    C7/Bb x10033
    F/a   x03211
    Fm/Ab 433111
    C/g   332010
    D9/f# 200210 or 202210
    G11   333211 (w/thumb) or 3x3211
    C+    x32110

    C                        G/b
    When the rain is blowing in your face
    Gm/Bb                  F/a
    and the whole world is on your case
    Fm/Ab           C/g
    I could offer a warm embrace
    D9/f#       G11     C
    to make you feel my love

    When evening shatters and the stars appear
    and there is no one there to dry your tears
    I could hold you for a million years
    to make you feel my love

    F                            C
    I know you haven't made your mind up yet
    C+          F            C
    but I would never do you wrong
    F                             C
    I've known it from the moment that we met
    Dm                            G
    no doubt in my mind where you belong

    I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
    I'd go crawling down the avenue
    Oh there's nothing that I wouldn't do
    to make you feel my love

    The storms are raging on the rolling sea
    and on the highway of regret
    the winds of change are blowing wild and free
    you ain't seen nothing like me yet

    I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
    nothing that I wouldn't do
    go to the ends of the earth for you
    to make you feel my love
