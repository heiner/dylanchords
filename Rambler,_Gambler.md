          G                            C                D
    I'm a rambler and a gambler, I'm a long way from my home
           G            C       G                   D
    If the people don't like me, they can leave me alone

    Come sit down beside me, come sit down right here
    Come sit down long you want to, love you always to hear

    When you get to Wyoming, a letter you'll see
    If you get into trouble, just you write after me

    For I once had a lover, Her age was 16
    She's a flower of Belton, and a rose of Seline

    Her parents was against me, now she is the same
    If I've writ on your book, love, just you blot out my name

    Oh, there's changes in the ocean, there's changes in the sea
    There's changes in my true love, ain't no change in me
