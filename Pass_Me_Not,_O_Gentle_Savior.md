    G       C             G
    Pass me not, O gentle Savior,
    D              G
    Hear my humble cry
    G        C               G
    While on others Thou art calling,
    D              G
    Do not pass me by

    G       C
    Savior, Savior,
    G              D
    Hear my humble cry
    G        C               G
    While on others Thou art calling,
    D              G
    Do not pass me by

    Place me at Thy throne of mercy
    Find my sweet relief.
    While I kneel in deep contrition
    Help my unbelief

    Savior, Savior,
    Hear my humble cry
    While on others Thou art calling,
    Do not pass me by

    [instr. verse]

    Savior, Savior,
    Hear my humble cry
    While on others Thou art calling,
    D              C   D7  G
    Do not pass me by

Additional verses not sung by Dylan:

    Trusting only in Thy merit,
    Would I seek Thy face;
    Heal my wounded, broken spirit,
    Save me by Thy grace.

    Thou the Spring of all my comfort,
    More than life to me,
    Whom have I on earth beside Thee?
    Whom in heav'n but Thee?
