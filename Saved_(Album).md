Introductory Remarks

</h2>
<h3>
Eyolf Østrem

</h3>
While there is general agreement that no matter what one thinks about
the lyrics on <em>Slow Train Coming</em>, musically it is one of Dylan's
strongest, the general verdict is not equally lenient with
<em>Saved</em>. With its ghastly cover — rivalled in tackiness only by
<em>Shot of Love</em> — and its unequivocal title, it has proved to be
an even bitterer pill to swallow than the precursor.

Which is understandable, but not quite fair. <em>Saved</em> is an
excellent album, provided one can endure the obnoxious born-again
evangelization. It may be a far cry from <em>Slow Train Coming</em> in
the areas of polish and commercial appeal, but it has an energy, a
punch, and a new approach to communication and message that is quite
unique in Dylan's production, and, as such, quite refreshing.

It should be said, however, that this more positive verdict is only
partly true if one refers to the published album. <em>Saved</em> is
unique in connection with Dylan in consisting only/mostly of songs that
had already been tried out on stage for a long time before they were
committed to vinyl. There is critical and historiographical consensus
that the album suffered from this: by the time of the sessions for the
record, the band (the same band that had played the songs on tour —
another Dylan rarity) was already tired, and the spirit of the live
renditions, which even the staunchest critics could not deny, did not
translate well into a studio production.

There may be something true in this. Many of the songs are exuberant
numbers of praise and thanksgiving, which come better into its own from
a stage, where extatically jubilant confession seems more natural than
on a record.

This applies to the <strong>title track</strong>, a born-again statement
if there ever was one, slightly too over-eager to be taken quite
seriously (unless one shares the sentiment), perhaps, but a powerful and
driving gospel rock number all the same, which I don't mind listening
to.

The same could be said about the brother-in-arms,<strong> “Solid
Rock”</strong> (or, as the full title goes when it is presented during
the shows: “Hanging On To A Solid Rock Made Before The Foundation Of The
World”); and, to an even higher degree, to <strong>“Pressing
On”</strong> og <strong>“Are You Ready?”</strong> — the intensity that
grows out of the slow build-up of these two songs during the live
concerts can make even the hardest of heart jump to his feet and
rejoice: “Yes! I'm ready! Take me, Bob! Take me with you!”, but that is
mostly lost in the album version.

It probably couldn't be any other way. None of the songs I've mentioned
are among his strongest — from the gospel period or any other — but
their effect depends on <em>presence</em>: the <em>physical</em>
presence of the person and the band producing a sound of wall to bang
one's head against, and the <em>temporal</em> presence, exploiting the
contrast between the <em>indefiniteness</em> of not knowing where this
is going to end, and the <em>inevitability</em> of the process set in
motion by the first “on-an-don-an-don-an-doon”. In the absence that the
record medium necessarily entails, some of that is naturally lost. But
some remains (and five bonus points for trying).

Besides, it doesn't matter: there are strong songs left that <em>do</em>
make the transition from concert stage to recording studio. Partly,
perhaps, because they are stronger songs altogether, but mainly because
they don't depend on the live situation to the same extent.

<strong>“In The Garden”</strong> is easily Dylan's most harmonically
complex song, and although it shares some traits with the likes of
“Saved”, such as the escalating intensity and the lyric repetitiveness,
it depends more on the harmonic meandering to hold our attention.

Both <strong>“Covenant Woman”</strong> and <strong>“Saving
Grace”</strong> are harmonically interesting, although not as wild as
“In the Garden”. They are also touching, introspective reflections on
the role of faith and salvation in the trials and tribulations of
everyday life (at least that's what a theologian might say about them).
Especially “Covenant Woman” stands out in this respect, in a way which
transcends the religious sphere. Lines like:

He must have loved me so much to send me someone as fine as

`   you.`

and

I'll always be right by your side — I've got

`   a covenant too.`

work well with or without God in the equation.

This leaves the two real gems. <strong>“What Can I Do For You”</strong>
gives us Dylan's best harmonica solos ever — for once captured better on
an official album than in any live rendition, at least among the ones
I've heard. It is inventive, it is raw, and it is fragile, all at the
same time. (It may be an inappropriate kind of metaphor for this
particular album, but there's good sex in those two solos.) The sound of
the mix in general strikes me as a bit on the hard side, but the harp
sound is unsurpassed.

And last but not least, and the opener, <strong>“A Satisfied
Mind”</strong>, which in my book is one of Dylan's crowning achievements
as a singer. It's not powerful, it's not showy, at times he breaks like
a little girl, but there is an intimacy in the delivery which gives the
message credibility and urgency. The interaction with the backing
singers is exquisite all the way through, and although my mental image
of the song is that of calm deliberation, there is actually an intensity
which just grows as the song progresses. There happens remarkably much
in a little less than two minutes.

Have I made my point clear enough? Damn, this is one hell of an album.
If you're a godless heathen, don't let the cover scare you away from
this album. And if you're a true believer, don't let your benevolence
and agreement prevent the album from grabbing hold of you in ways and
places you might not have expected.
