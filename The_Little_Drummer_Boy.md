              Bb
    Come they told me, pa rum pa pom pom

    A new born King to see, pa rum pa pom pom
    F
     Our finest gifts we bring, pa rum pa pom pom
             Bb                Eb
    To lay before the King, pa rum pa pom pom,
    Bb              F
    rum pa pom pom, rum pa pom pom
    Bb
      And so to honor Him, pa rum pa pom pom,
    F       Bb
    When we come.

    Little Baby, pa rum pa pom pom
    I am a poor boy too, pa rum pa pom pom
    I have no gift to bring, pa rum pa pom pom
    That's fit to give a King, pa rum pa pom pom,
    rum pa pom pom, rum pa pom pom.
    Shall I play for you, pa rum pa pom pom,
    On my drum?

    <span class="chorus">[Mary nodded, pa rum pa pom pom
    The ox and lamb kept time, pa rum pa pom pom]
    </span>I played my drum for Him, pa rum pa pom pom
    I played my best for Him, pa rum pa pom pom,
    rum pa pom pom, rum pa pom pom.
    Then He smiled at me, pa rum pa pum pum
    Me and my drum.
    Me and my drum.
