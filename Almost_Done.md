Words (?) and music Bob Dylan  
Played, more or less improvised, on the Verona and Beverly Theatre
rehearsals, May 1984  
Tabbed and transcribed (sort of) by Eyolf Ã˜strem

It seemed meaningless to try and transcribe the mumbling on the Beverly
Theatre version (May 23). Verona was a little less meaningless...

            C#m
    I stood by
               G#m
    I stood by you
             C#m
    Stood by her
                  F#m
    Oh don't be untrue
                 E
    It's already there
                   A
    for to see the one
               F#m
    oh now she rode
                 E
    She's almost done

    Almost done
    Almost done
    Palestine glow [girl]
    You're the one
    [Oh not I know]
    It might not do
    It's already done
    for light and blue

    Almost done
    almost done
    but I don't stand missed
    but you're the one
    oh you're the child
    I'm a-trustin' you
    to trust me down
    just trust me too

    All the night
    fortune don't last
    Gonna be lucky,
    more than in the past
    It's already there,
    Already new
    Oh, trust in me,
    I'll trust in you

    So goodbye
    [sob me the pros] :-) [or: "save me the prose"?]
    goodbye baby
    would you hold me close
    hold me close
    or say goodbye
    [moon up by night]
    in [the empty] the sky
