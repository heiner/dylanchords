    E     A     E        E7
       Tomorrow night
                               A
    will you remember what you said tonight
             Am    B7                            E  Fdim F#m  B7
    Tomorrow night   will all the thrill be gone
             E           E7
    Tomorrow night
                            A
    will it be just another memory
              Am
    Or just another song
    B7                           E
    that's in my heart to linger on

    B                E
    Your lips are so tender,
    B                         E
    your heart is beating fast
    G#m
    And you willingly surrender
    C#m        B       A       B7
    to me, but darling will it last

    Tomorrow night
    will you be with me when the moon is bright
    Tomorrow night
    will you say those lovely things you said tonight

    Your lips are so tender,
    your heart is beating fast
    And you willingly surrender
    to me, but darling will it last
