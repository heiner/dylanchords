Tabbed by Eyolf Ã˜strem

The lyrics vary somewhat from Van Morrison's.  
I can't quite make out what he's singing in the last verse. Send me a
note if you can hear it.

    [instr. verse]

    C               G/b            Am   F
     I'm carryin' a torch for you
    C         G     F
     I'm carryin' a torch
    C              G/b         Am             F
     You don't know, you don't know what it's worth
    C        G               C
     To keep carryin' a torch

    Flame of love it burns so bright
    That is my desire
    Keep on liftin' me, liftin' me up
    Higher and higher

    G7
    You're the keeper of the flame
    F                      C
     And you burn so bright
    G7
     why don't we, why don't we re-connect
    F                         G7
     And move up into the light

    I've been going to and fro on this and that
    cause I'm still carryin' a torch
    You must know, You must know what it's worth
    To keep carryin' a torch

    Baby you're the keeper of the flame
    And you burn so bright
     why don't we, why don't we re-connect
    And move all up into the light

    I've been calling you on the phone
    Cause I'm carryin' a torch
    I can do it all on my own
    Keep carryin' a torch

    I'm carryin' a torch for you, baby
    I'm carryin' a torch
    You don't know, you don't know what it's worth
    To keep carryin' a torch

    I've been carryin', I've been carryin' a torch for you, baby
    I keep carryin' a torch
    [You don't know, you don't know what it's worth]
                            F        G   C
    Cause I, I'm carryin' a torch.
