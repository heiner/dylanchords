<h1 class="songtitle">Sittin' on Top of the World</h1>


<p>Trad.<br /> 
Released by Bob Dylan on <a class="recordlink" href="index.htm">Good As I Been To You</a> (1992)<br /> 
Tabbed by Eyolf &Oslash;strem</p>

<p>It seems that the B is played with an open E string: x24400, but the
full B chord x24442 is fine too; you don't really need those high
strings anyway, since mostly the song is played only on the bass
strings.</p>

<p>The E4 chord (E on the fourth fret) = xxx454. Could be played on the
seventh fret as well (079990)</p>

<p>Standard blues accompaniment:</p>

           E       
Was in the summer,
   
One early fall,
               A
Just tryin' to find my
               E
Little all and all
          E4
Now she's gone,
            B
An' I don't worry.
          A                     E
Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world.

<pre class="verse">
Was in the spring,
One summer's day.
Just when she left me,
She gone to stay.
Now she's gone.
An' I don't worry.
Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world.

<pre class="verse">
Now don't come runnin'
Holdin' up your hand.
Can get me a woman
Quick as you can get a man.
Now she's gone.
An' I don't worry.
Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world.

Happen for days,
Didn't know your name.
Oh, why should I worry
Or crave you in vain?
Now she's gone.
An' I don't worry.
Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world.

Went to the station,
Down in the yard,
Gonna get me a freight train,
Work's done got hard.
Now she's gone.
An' I don't worry.
Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world.

The lonesome days,
They have gone by,
Why should I beg you?
You said good-bye.
Now she's gone.
An' I don't worry.
Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world.
