      C/g        G7'
    I can't understand
            C/g      G7'
    She let go of my hand
        C/g          G7'        C    Csus4   C
    An' left me here facing the wall
        C/g          G7'
    I'd sure like to know
    C/g         G7'
    Why she did go
        C/g         G7'             C   Csus4  C
    But I can't get close to her at all
              Am                              Em
    Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime
        F                    G  G6 G7
    She said she would never forget
            C/g      G7'
    But now mornin's clear
         C/g          G7'
    It's like I ain't here
        C/g          G7    C
    She acts like we never met.

    It's all new to me
    Like some mystery
    It could even be like a myth
    But it's hard to think on
    That she's the same one
    That last night I was with
    From darkness, dreams are deserted
    Am I still dreamin' yet?
    I wish she'd unlock
    Her voice once and talk
    'Stead of acting like we never met

    If she ain't feelin' well
    Then why don't she tell
    'Stead of turnin' her back to my face
    Without any doubt
    She seems too far out
    For me to return to or chase
    Though her skirt it swayed as the guitar played
    Her mouth was watery and wet
    But now something has changed
    For she ain't the same
    She just acts like we never have met.

    If I didn't have to guess
    I'd gladly confess
    To anything I might've tried
    If I was with her too long
    Or have done something wrong
    I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide
    Though the night ran swirling and whirling
    I remember her whispering yet
    But evidently she don't
    evidently she won't
    She just acts like we never have met.

    I'm leavin' today
    I'll be on my way
    Of this I can't say very much
    But if you want me to
    I can be just like you
    And pretend that we never have touched
    And if anybody asks me: "Is it easy to forget?"
    I say, "It's easily done
    You just pick anyone
    And pretend that you never have met."

Live 1964 version

</h2>
The main difference from the album version is the long guitar intro,
which is once interrupted: “Oh God! [strumming] Here's the second verse
of it”, and later: “Does anybody know the first verse of this song?”

The other main difference is that the parts of the following verses have
been mixed:

    If she ain't feelin' well
    Then why don't she tell
    'Stead of turnin' her back to my face
    Without any doubt
    She seems too far out
    For me to return to or chase
    Though the night ran swirling and whirling
    I remember her whispering yet
    But evidently she don't
    And evidently she won't
    She just acts like we never have met.

    If I didn't have to guess
    I'd gladly confess
    To anything I might've tried
    If I was with her too long
    Or have done something wrong
    I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide
    Though her skirt it swayed as the guitar played
    Her mouth was watery and wet
    But now something has changed
    For she ain't the same
    She just acts like we never have met.

(The version from Biograph (May 6 1966) and Live 1966 (May 17 1966) is
basically the same, only in E major. The recurring riff is played by
Robbie Robertson on the frets `----97` and `----75`.)

    She acts like we never met.
