Words and music Bob Dylan  
Released on [Planet Waves](Planet Waves) (1974)  
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

The song could equally well be played with C chords and a capo on the
4th fret. Such a version is appended at the end.

The intro is played rather freely (which is a nice way of saying that
they aren't exactly tight...) – and with both a bass and a guitar. The
tab below is just a suggestion of an approximation.

    A                           F#7
    I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere.
    E                   G#          C#m   E/b  A
    You got something I want plenty of
    E             B             A   G#m  F#m  E
    Ooh, a little touch of your love.

    Hazel, stardust in your eye
    You're goin' somewhere and so am I.
    I'd give you the sky high above
    Ooh, for a little touch of your love.

    G#                        C#m
    Oh no, I don't need any reminder
    G#                        C#m
    To know how much I really care
    F#
    But it's just making me blinder and blinder
                B       A        G#m              F#m
    Because I'm up on a hill and still you're not there.

    Hazel, you called and I came,
    Now don't make me play this waiting game.
    You've got something I want plenty of
    Ooh, a little touch of your love.
