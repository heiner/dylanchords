Words and music Bob Dylan<br>
Released on [[Planet Waves]] (1974)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

The song could equally well be played with C chords and a capo on the
4th fret. Such a version is appended at the end.

The intro is played rather freely (which is a nice way of saying that
they aren't exactly tight...) – and with both a bass and a guitar. The
tab below is just a suggestion of an approximation.

I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere.

You got something I want plenty of

Ooh, a little touch of your love.

Hazel, stardust in your eye
You're goin' somewhere and so am I.
I'd give you the sky high above
Ooh, for a little touch of your love.

Oh no, I don't need any reminder

Hazel, you called and I came,
Now don't make me play this waiting game.
You've got something I want plenty of
Ooh, a little touch of your love.
