Just let me love you tonight
Am(/c) D           G  Em
    Forget about tomorrow
Am(/c) D              G        Em
    My darlin' let me hold you tight
    C G/b Am  D  G       C/g  G
And never let me go

Dry your eyes
No tears and no sorrow
Cling to me with all your might
And never let me go

A million times or more dear

You said we'd never part
    B7       Em
But lately I find
  A7             D...C...G/b...D9
A stranger in my arms

Give me the right
In summer or in spring-time
To tell the world that you are mine
And never let me go.
