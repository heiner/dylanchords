    (/d-e-f#) G

                G          Em
    Just let me love you tonight
    Am(/c) D           G  Em
        Forget about tomorrow
    Am(/c) D              G        Em
        My darlin' let me hold you tight
        C G/b Am  D  G       C/g  G
    And never let me go

    Dry your eyes
    No tears and no sorrow
    Cling to me with all your might
    And never let me go

    G7

      C                Cm
    A million times or more dear
        G         D     G        G7
    You said we'd never part
        B7       Em
    But lately I find
      A7             D...C...G/b...D9
    A stranger in my arms

    Give me the right
    In summer or in spring-time
    To tell the world that you are mine
    And never let me go.

    C  G/b  Am D  G
