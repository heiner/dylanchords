Written by Bob Dylan/Sam Shepard  
Recorded as "New Danville Girl" Dec 1984 during the [Empire
Burlesque](Empire Burlesque "wikilink") sessions, and released with
rewritten lyrics on [Knocked out Loaded](Knocked out Loaded "wikilink")
(1986), as the only real excuse for that album. Since it's one of
Dylan's greatest epic ballads, it's a good excuse.  
Tabbed and transcribed by Eyolf Østrem

* * * * *

I've indicated the chords with simple chord names, but they are played
with the first string open most of the time, which gives the following
chord names:

    D  = Dadd9   xx0230
    Bm = Bmadd11 224430
    E  = Esus4   022200 (or E11 022232)

The A is usually embellished by Asus4 (x02230) or Asus2 (x02200),
occasionally also A6 (x02222)

    Intro:

    |: D  A/c#  Bm  E  |A Asus4      :| 

    A                                                            D
    I wish I could remember that movie just a little bit better,
    Bm                                  E                 A
    All I remember about it was that it starred Gregory Peck.
           A                                                       D
    He was shot down in the back by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself.
        Bm                                            E                        A
    The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.

Well, there was this movie I seen one time,  
About a man riding 'cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck.  
He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself.  
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the
neck.

Well the Sheriff beat that boy into a bloody pulp,  
As the dying gunfighter lay in the sun and gasped for his last breath.  
'Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and
square.  
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death'.

Well, the marshal, now he beat that kid to a bloody pulp

Well I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in,

I can still see the day that you came to me on the painted desert  
In your busted-down Ford and your platform heels.  
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet,  
Ah, but you were right. It was perfect, as I got in behind the wheel.

We drove that car all night into San Antone  
And we slept near the Alamo, fell out under the stars.  
Way down in Mexico you went out to see a doctor and you never came
back.  
I stayed there a while, till the whole place it started feelin' like
mars.

Well, I'm driving this car and the sun is comin' up over the Rockies.  
Somethin' about it reminds me of you, like when she sings "Baby, let the
good times roll".  
But I'm too over the edge to remember the things we used to talk about
or do,  
And she don‘t want to remind me, she knows this car would go out of
control.

Well, we're drivin' this car and the sun is comin' up over the
Rockies,  
Now I know she ain't you but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm
in her soul.  
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore to remember
the times when I was your only man  
And she don't want to remind me. She knows this car would go out of
control.

Well. we crossed the Panhandle and then we headed out towards
Amarillo,  
Rushin' down where Henry Porter used to live, he owned a wreckin' lot
outside of town,  
We could see Ruby in the window, as we came rolling up in a trail of
dust.  
She said 'Henry's not here, he took off, but y'all can come in and stay
a while'.

Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo

outside of town about a mile.  
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied
back. She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.  
She said, "Henry ain't here but you can come on in, he'll be back in a
little while."

Well she told us times were tough but we never knew how bad off she
was.  
You know she would change the subject every time money came up.  
You know her eyes were filled with so much sadness, she was so
disillusioned with everything,  
She said 'Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt'.

</td>

Then she told us how times were tough and about how she was thinkin' of
bummin' a ride back to where she started.  
But ya know, she changed the subject every time money came up.  
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead." You could tell she
was so broken-hearted.  
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."

'How far y'all going?' Ruby asked us with a sigh.  
'We're going all the way 'till the wheels fall off and burn.  
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water
moccasin dies'.  
Ruby just smiled and said 'Ah, you know, some babies never learn'.

I keep trying to remember that movie though, and it does keep comin'
back,  
But I can't remember what part I played or who I was supposed to be.  
All I can remember about it is it's starring Gregory Peck and he was in
it,  
And everything he did in it reminded me of me. Yeah!

Something about that movie though, well I just can't get it out of my
head  
But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to

All I remember about it was Gregory Peck and the way people moved  
And a lot of them seemed to be lookin' my way.

Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour.  
I was crossing the street when they opened fire.  
I didn't know whether to duck or to run so I ran.  
Sounded to me like I was bein' chased by the midnight choir.

said 'A man with no alibi'.

It was the best acting I ever saw you do.

I've always been an emotional person but this time it was asking too

oh yes I could,

You know, it's funny how people just want to believe what's
convenient.  
Nothing happens on purpose, it's an accident if it happens at all.  
And everything that's happening to us seems like it's happening without
our consent,  
But we're busy talking back and forth to our shadows on an old stone
wall.

</td>

You know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em
planned.  
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter is that his name
wasn't Henry Porter.  
And you know there was somethin' about you baby that I liked that was
always too good for this world  
Just like you always said there was something about me you liked that I
left behind in the French Quarter.

Oh, you got to talk to me now baby, tell me about the man that you used
to love,  
And tell me about your dreams, just before the time you passed out. Oh,
yeah!  
Tell me about the time that our engine broke down and it was the worst
of times,  
Tell me about all the things that I couldn't do nothin' about.

Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections than
people who are most content.  
I don't have any regrets, they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone.  
You always said people don't do what they believe in, they just do
what's most convenient, then they repent.  
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof
stays on

There was a movie I seen one time, I think I sat through it twice.  
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound.  
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck, he wore a gun and
he was shot in the back.  
Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down.
