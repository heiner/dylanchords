Se&ntilde;or, se&ntilde;or, can you tell me where we're headin'?
        C          /b      Am
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
Am                G               F(maj7)
Seems like I been down this way before.
Dm                             Am
 Is there any truth in that, se&ntilde;or?

Se&ntilde;or, se&ntilde;or, do you know where she is hidin'?
How long are we gonna be ridin'?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
Will there be any comfort there, se&ntilde;or?

          C                                 Em
There's a wicked wind still blowin' on that upper deck,
           F                                   Am
There's an iron cross still hanging down from around her neck.
          C                                   Em
There's a marchin' band still playin' in that vacant lot 
          F                                          Am
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, &quot;Forget me not.&quot;
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
Se&ntilde;or, se&ntilde;or, I can see that painted wagon, 
smell the tail of the dragon. 
Can't stand the suspense anymore. 
Can you tell me who to contact here, se&ntilde;or?
</pre>

<pre class="bridge">
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled 
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field. 
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring 
He said: &quot;Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing.&quot;
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
Se&ntilde;or, se&ntilde;or, you know their hearts are as hard as leather. 
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together. 
I just gotta pick myself up off the floor. 
I'm ready when you are, se&ntilde;or.

Se&ntilde;or, se&ntilde;or, let's overturn these tables, 
Disconnect these cables. 
This place don't make sense to me no more. 
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, se&ntilde;or?
