Trad.  
Played by Bob Dylan six times in 1992  
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem, based on the version from April 3, 1992  
Lyrics revised from the version given at the mudcat cafe

* * * * *

The first half-verse is slightly irregular, but all subsequent verses
follow the pattern of the second half-verse (“Her true love...”).  
An outline of the melody is picked out on the bass strings, in the very
loose rhythm in which the song is played. The third line of the verses,
e.g., could be played something like:

      C/g  /a    C                                 F       C         G
      :    .     .    .     :   .   .        .     :   .   .   .     :

         G                            Dmadd9/f
    Come all you maids, both near and far,
               G     F
    and listen to my ditty
          C/g   /a   C
    'Twas near Gravesend there lived a maid
        F   C           G       C/g  G
    She was so neat and pretty.

        Dmadd9/f         G        C
    Her true love he was pressed away
        Csus4    C       G       F
    And drownded in some foreign sea
          C/g    /a   C
    Which caused this fair maid to say
                        G       C/g  G
    'I'll be a rambling sailor.'

    With trousers blue and jacket white
    Just like a sailor neat and tight
    The sea it was the heart's delight
    Of the female rambling sailor.
    From stem to stern she freely goes
    She braves all dangers, fears no foes
    But soon you shall hear of the overthrow
    Of the female rambling sailor

    Never did her courage fail
    Through stormy seas and wintery gale
    Always did this fair maid prevail
    This female rambling sailor.
    From stem to stern she freely went
    Where oft-times she'd been many
    Her hand did slip and down she fell
    She calmly bade this world farewell.

    When her lily-white breast in sight it came
    It appeared to be a female's frame
    Rebecca Young it was the name
    Of the female rambling sailor.
    May the willows wave around her grave
    And round the laurels planted *)
    May the roses sweet grow at her feet
    Of the one who was undaunted.

    So, come all you maids, both near and far
    And listen to my story
    Her body is anchored in the ground
    Let's hope her soul's in glory. **)
    From the river Thames she's known quite well
    No sailor there could her excel
    Let one tear fall as a last farewell
    To the female rambling sailor.

\*) Dylan sings: “May the laurels wave around her grave / and laurels
a-planted”
