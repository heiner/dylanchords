            C
Most of the time
    F
I'm clear focused all around
            C
Most of the time
           F
I can keep both feet on the ground
Am                      F
  I can follow the path,  I can read the sign
Am                   F
  Stay right with it   when the road unwinds
                 C                F
I can handle whatever I stumble upon
             Am             F
I don't even notice   she's gone
            C
Most of the time.

Most of the time it's well understood
Most of the time I wouldn't change it if I could
I can make it all match up
I can hold my own
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone
I can survive and I can endure
And I don't even think about her
Most of the time.

Most of the time my head is on straight
Most of the time I'm strong enough not to hate
I don't build up illusion 'til it makes me sick
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick
I can smile in the face of mankind
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
Most of the time.

Am
  Most of the time
C
  she ain't even in my mind
Am
  I wouldn't know her if I saw her
C
  She's that far behind
E
  Most of the time
Am
  I can't even be sure
E
  If she was ever with me
Am                      F/g
  Or if I was ever with her
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
Most of the time I'm halfway content
Most of the time I know exactly where it went
I don't cheat on myself I don't run and hide
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside
I don't compromise and I don't pretend
I don't even care if I ever see her again
Most of the time.

<h3 class="songversion">''Tell Tale Signs'' version</h3>

The chord that I have written as <tt>/g</tt> changes through the song,
from a simple Am/g (3x2210) to a full C/g, played as 3x2013, which at one
point is played 3x203x, quickly changed to the correct form, which gives an
interesting variation …

Also worth noting is the slowing down of the harmonic rhythm in the
last verse, which brings the song closer to the album version in a way
which reminds of [[On A Rainy Afternoon]] from
''Eat The Document''.

<tt>G11</tt> is played <tt>3x3211</tt>.
