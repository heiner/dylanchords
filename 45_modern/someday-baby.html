<p>It sounds like the main lead guitar might play with a capo on the 6th fret, but it might as well be played uncapoed; these are all standard blues licks that any decent guitarist should be able to play anywhere on the neck. </p>

Someday baby, you ain't gon' worry po' me any more
</pre>
<pre>
Well, you take my money and you turn me out
You fill me up with nothin' but self doubt
Someday baby, you ain't gon' worry po' me any more
</pre>
<pre>
When I was young, driving was my crave
You drive me so hard almost to the grave
Someday baby, you ain't gon' worry po' me any more
</pre>
<pre>
I'm so hard pressed, my mind tied up in knots
I keep recycling the same old thoughts
Someday baby, you ain't gon' worry po' me any more
</pre>
<pre>
So many good things in life that I overlooked
I don't know what to do now, baby, you got me so hooked
Someday baby, you ain't gon' worry po' me any more
</pre>
<pre>
Well, I don't want to brag, I wanna wring your neck
When all else fails, I'll make it a matter of self respect
Someday baby, you ain't gon' worry po' me any more
</pre>
<pre>
You can take your clothes, put 'em in a sack
You're goin' down the road, baby, and you can't come back
Someday baby, you ain't gon' worry po' me any more
</pre>
<pre>
I tried to be friendly, I tried to be kind
I'm gonna drive you from your home just like I was driven from mine
Someday baby, you ain't gon' worry po' me any more
</pre>
<pre>
Living this way ain't a natural thing to do
Why was I born to love you'
Someday baby, you ain't gon' worry po' me any more
</pre>
