Trad. <br>
As performed by Bob Dylan on the “Karen Wallace tape” (home of Karen
Wallace, May 1960)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

“Syrupy”, was it? Apparently the Wallace tape has been authenticated
(and it does sound quite a bit like the other early tapes, to my ears
anyway). Although it's a decent recording, there are words here that I
can't quite make out. The below is a suggestion, and as always I
welcome corrections.

Chords:

<pre class="chords">
Fmaj7    133210
G6       320000
</pre>

The rhythm that goes through the whole song, is a slow:

<pre class="tab">
    C           Fmaj7
    :     .     .     .
||--0-----0---0-0-----0---0--||
||*-1-----1---1-1-----1---1-*||
||--0-----0---0-2-----2---2--||
||--2-----2---2-3-----3---3--||
||*-3-----3---3-3-----3---3-*||
||--------------1-----1---1--||
</pre>

<pre class="verse">

Ah, I don't know the word to find
  C        Fmaj7     C              Fmaj7
A word for [...],*) [mean life this time]
  C      Fmaj7        C            Fmaj7

Fmaj7 .  G  G6  C  .  .  .

C        Fmaj7     C         Fmaj7
Oh, Mary Ann, Mary Ann, Mary Ann

Fmaj7 .  G  G6  [C  .  .  .] (tape break)
