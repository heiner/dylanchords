    A
    I'm searching for phrases
    D
    To sing your praises.
    A                   D
    I need to tell someone.
    A                F#m
    It's soon after midnight,
    D       E              A     E
    And my day has just begun

    A gal named Honey
    Took my money
    She was passing by.
    It's soon after midnight,
    D       E              A       A7
    And the moon is in my eye

    D
    My heart is cheerful.
    A
    It's never fearful.
    D                             A       A7
    I've been down on the killing floors.
    D
    I'm in no great hurry,
    A
    I'm not afraid of your fury.
    D           A                   E
    I've faced stronger walls than yours.

    Charlotte's a harlot,.
    Dresses in scarlet.
    Mary dresses in green.
    It's soon after midnight,
    And I've got a date with the fairy queen.

    They chirp and they chatter,
    What does it matter?
    They're lying and dying in their blood.
    Two-timing Slim,
    Who's every heard of him?
    I'll drag his corpse through the mud.

    It's now or never
    More than ever.
    When I met you, I didn't think you would do
    Its soon after midnight,
    And I don't want nobody but you.
