Dropped C tuning (C-A-d-g-b-e')

    F    003211
    G7   220001

Robbie's guitar is uncapoed. Here's one version of Robbie's little “du
du du” figure:

    R: G(7)                                D7
    D: C(7)                                G7
       :   .   .   .     :   .   .   .     :   .

As for the lyrics – well, at least I tried...

    What kind of friend is this
    C
    Speakin' like an awful man

    She don't form part of me
    G7                F
    She don't long to follow me
          C
    Well, every kind of thing I was . . .

    Tell me what kind of friend is this

    What kind of friend is this?
    Who loves me behind my back
    What kind of friend is this
    Shows up every place I've been
    She act kind of 'lone
    but she don't
    She making a loan
    But you know she won't
    She got a language [in] the morning
    And she's making it on my bed
    Aw, what kind of friend is this.

    What kind of friend is this
    makin' [...]
    What kind of friend is this
    Losing up anything
    Back off, [boy]
    When she goes down
    [Lay down laid]
    She's walking around
    Well, she ain't got nothin'
    but she's teedle toodle tummin' on a
    pack of beens
    Tell me what kind of friend is this?

         F
    Well she [don't lean if she don't man]

    You know she's gonna be her dog.
    F

    Heat stopped a-beating and she [...]

    Well, what kind of friend is this
    make me holler to and fro
    who wants to go everywhere I wanna go
    Back off, she
    don't care for me
    [...] own lady
    if she could only see
    I'd give her everything
    If she comes back along to this [/hiss?].
    Tell me what kind of friend is this?
