Words and music Bob Dylan<br>
Released on [[New Morning]] (1970), [[Greatest Hits II]] (1971)
and [[Biograph]] (1985), and in an earlier version (w/George
Harrison) on [[The Bootleg Series 1-3]] (1991)<br>

Tabbed by Eyolf Ã˜strem

This one is more tricky than it seems at first. The tricky thing is
actually the E chord. It sounds like it is (or rather: it's
definitely) played in the fourth position, with the prominent g# on
the 1st string (4th fret), as if there was a capo on the fourth fret,
but the G#m' and F#m' chords are definitely played:

<pre class="chords">
G#m'    466400  (use the thumb for these two,
F#m'    244200  otherwise it won't work)
</pre>

So that rules out the capo. That would suggest these chords:

<pre class="chords">
E       076454 (barre)
B       799877
A       577655
</pre>

Which may be a bit awkward to play, but that would be more than enough
compensated by the thrill of playing exactly as it was done then,
right...?<br>
One can of course use any variety of these chords, or even a capo on
the fourth fret, with the chords C, G, F, Em Dm.

Wait for the mornin' light
To shine in through,
But it would not be new,

Anyway it wouldn't ring true,
