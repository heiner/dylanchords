             E
    Ain't it hard to stumble

    And land in some funny lagoon?
             A
    Ain't it hard to stumble
                             E
    And land in some muddy lagoon?
                         B7
    Especially when it's nine below zero
        A (n.c.)                         E
    And   three o'clock in the afternoon.

    Ain't gonna hang no picture,
    Ain't gonna hang no picture frame.
    Ain't gonna hang no picture,
    Ain't gonna hang no picture frame.
    Well, I might look like Robert Ford
    But I feel just like a Jesse James.

    Well, I wish I was on some
    Australian mountain range.
    Oh, I wish I was on some
    Australian mountain range.
    I got no reason to be there, but I
    Imagine it would be some kind of change.

    I got my dark sunglasses,
    I got for good luck my black tooth.
    I got my dark sunglasses,
    I'm carryin' for good luck my black tooth.
    Don't ask me nothin' about nothin',
    I just might tell you the truth.

    I got a woman in Jackson,
    I ain't gonna say her name.
    I got a woman in Jackson,
    I ain't gonna say her name.
    She's a brown-skin woman,
    but I love her just the same.
