I suggest a capo on the 3rd fret (sounding key Eb major)

G11 = 3x3211 or 333211  
G6 = 32000

                G/b
    I bless the day I found you
    Am         G6
     I want my arms around you
    F         C/e
     And so I beg you
    Dm  G11          C
        Let it be me

    G11 . . G6

    Don't take this heaven from me
    If you must cling to someone
    Now and forever
    Let it be me

    F             Em
     Each time we meet love
    F          C
     I find complete love
    F             C
     Without your sweet love
    F                E7
     What would life be ?

    So never leave me lonely
    Tell me that you love me only
    And say you'll always
    Let it be me

    [Instrumental bridge]

    So never leave me lonely
    Tell me you love me only
    An' say you'll always
    Let it be me
