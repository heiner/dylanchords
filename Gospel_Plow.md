         D
    Mary wore three links of chain,
          A              D
    Ev'ry link was Jesus name,
                G            A          D   [fill]
    Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on,
        A         D   [fill]
    Oh, Lord, Oh, Lord,
                G            A          D   [fill]
    Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on.

    Mary, Mark and Luke and John,
    All these prophets so good and gone,
    Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on,
    Oh, Lord, Oh, Lord,
    Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on.

    I never been to heaven, but I've been told,
    Streets up there are line with gold,
    Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on,
    Oh, Lord, Oh, Lord,
    Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on.

    Dig my grave with a bloody spade,
    See that my digger gets well paid,
    Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on,
    Oh, Lord, Oh, Lord,
    Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on.

    That gospel line gets mighty hot,
    But just hang on with all you got,
    Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on,
    Oh, Lord, Oh, Lord,
    Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on.

    When I get to the glory land,
    Gonna play in the glory land,
    Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on,
    Oh, Lord, Oh, Lord,
    Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on.
