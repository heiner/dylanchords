    Have fallen from her curls.

    Queen Mary, she's my friend
    Yes, I believe I'll go see her again
    Nobody has to guess
    That Baby can't be blessed
    Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest
    With her fog, with her amphetamine and her pearls.
    She takes just like a woman,
    And she makes love like a woman,
    And she aches just like a woman
    But she breaks just like a little girl.

    It was raining from the first

    And I was dying there of thirst
         C            Csus4 C
    So I came in here
             E
    And your long-time curse hurts

    But what's worse

    Is this pain in here

    I can't stay in here

    Ain't it clear that

    C F    G     C    etc.
    I just don't fit
    Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit
    And when we meet again
    Introduced as friends
    Please don't let on that you knew me when
    I was hungry and it was your world.
    You take just like a woman,
    And you take just like a woman, yes you do
    And you make love like a woman, yes you do
    and then you ache just like a woman,
    but you break just like a little girl.

Bob seems to be playing with a capo on the 4th fret, and more or less
the same chords as above.  
The 2nd guitar plays without a capo, using the following pattern
(w/variations):

      E           A     B7      E
      :     .     .     .       .     .     .     .

The easiest way to play the G7sus4 G7 G7sus2 G7 figure (same as in
Sad-Eyed Lady) would be:

“Before the Flood” version

Played in a very square 4/4 beat. The chords marked “/b”are probably
G/b, but may even be C/b (or rather: Cadd2/b: x20010). The second and
third Choruses are rushed out of tempo.

\* These Am chords are Ds in subsequent verses.
