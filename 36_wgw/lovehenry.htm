<pre class="verse">
     C                   F           C
&quot;Get down, get down Love Henry,&quot; she cried
                         G
&quot;And stay all night with me
  C                         F        C
I have gold chains, and the finest I have
C      G   F    C/e G/d C       
I'll apply them all to thee.&quot;

&quot;I can't get down and I shan't get down
Or stay all night with thee
Some pretty little girl in Cornersville
I love far better than thee.&quot;

He layed his head on a pillow of down
Kisses she gave him three
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
She murdered mortal he.

&quot;Get well, get well Love Henry,&quot; she cried
&quot;Get well, get well,&quot; said she
&quot;Oh don't you see my own heart's blood
Come flowin' down so free ?&quot;

She took him by his long yellow hair
And also by his feet
She plunged him into well water, where
It runs both cold and deep.

&quot;Lie there, lie there, Love Henry,&quot; she cried
&quot;'Til the flesh rots off your bones
Some pretty little girl in Cornersville
Will mourn for your return.&quot;

&quot;Hush up, hush up, my parrot,&quot; she cried
&quot;Don't tell no news on me
Or these costly beads around my neck
I'll apply them all to thee.&quot;

&quot;Fly down, fly down pretty bird,&quot; she cried
&quot;And light on my right knee
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
And hung on a willow tree.&quot;

&quot;I won't fly down, I can't fly down
And light on your right knee
A girl who would murder her own true love
Would kill a little bird like me.&quot;
