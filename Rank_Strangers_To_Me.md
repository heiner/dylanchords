                E          Esus4       E
    I wandered again to my home in the mountain
                                                B     B7
    Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free
                    E
    I looked for my friends but I never could find them
                          B                 E
    I found they were all rank strangers to me.

                              Esus4
    Ev'rybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger
                                          B     B7
    No mother or dad not a friend could I see
                     E
    They knew not my name and I knew not their faces
                          B                 E
    I found they were all rank strangers to me.

    "They all moved a way," said a voice of a stranger
    "To that bautiful home by the bright crystal sea"
    Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
    Where no one will be a stranger to me.

    Ev'rybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger
    No mother or dad not a friend could I see
    They knew not my name and I knew not their faces
    I found they were all rank strangers to me.
