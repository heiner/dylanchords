    Oh fare thee well my own true love
    G                        D
    Fare thee well but for a while

    The ship is waitin' an' the wind blows high

    An' I am bound away for the sea,

        (I am bound away for the sea, Mary Ann)

    Ten thousand miles away from home
    Ten thousand miles or more
    The sea may freeze an' the earth may burn
    If I never no more return to you,
    Mary Ann.

    Oh don't you see that crow fly high
    She'll surely turn to white
    If ever I prove false to you
    Let the day turn to night, my dear
    Mary Ann.

    Oh, if I had a flask of gin an' sugar here for two
    An' a great big bowl for to mix it in
    I'd pour a drink for you, my dear
    Mary Ann
    Yes I'd pour a drink for you, my dear
    Mary Ann.
