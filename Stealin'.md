<nowiki>*</nowiki>) In the harp interludes, the figure at “If you don't think I'm . . .” goes:

<pre class="tab">
  G D C  D  C G
  :   .   .   .
|-7-5-3--2--0-3---|
|-8-7-5--3--1-0---|
|-7-7-5--2--0-0---| repeat
|-----------2-0---|
|-----------3-2---|

Also, the A in the refrains is only used in the harp interludes, and
the G-G7 are twice as short there.
