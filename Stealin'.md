\*) In the harp interludes, the figure at “If you don't think I'm . . .”
goes:

      G D C  D  C G
      :   .   .   .
    |-7-5-3--2--0-3---|
    |-8-7-5--3--1-0---|
    |-7-7-5--2--0-0---| repeat
    |-----------2-0---|
    |-----------3-2---|
    |-------------3---|

Also, the A in the refrains is only used in the harp interludes, and the
G-G7 are twice as short there.
