    [fragment:]

    . . . and I knew right away
    That it was gossip not flowers that she had on her mind
    And this is what I heard my neighbor say.

* * * * *

    [new start, in D:]

      G                              D
    A tongue can accuse or carry bad news
        G                            D
    The seeds of destruction it will sow.
         G                                      D
    So unless you have made no mistakes in your life
       D          A               D
    Be careful of stones that you throw.

      D
    A neighbor was passin' my garden one time
       G
    She smiled and I knew right away
    D
     That it was gossip not flowers that she had on her mind
        A7
    And this is what I heard my neighbor say.

          D
    "That bad girl down the street, she should be run from our midst.
        G
    She drinks and she talks quite a lot
        (D)
    She knows not to speak to my child nor to me.”
                     A7
    My neighbor then smiled and I thought:

    A tongue can accuse and carry bad news
    The seeds of destruction it will sow.
    So unless you have made no mistakes in your life
    Be careful of stones that you throw.

    A car speeded by, the screamin' of brakes
    and a sound that made my blood chill
    For  my neighbor's one child had been pulled from the path
    And saved by a girl, lyin' still.

    Her child was unhurt and my neighbor cried out
    "Oh, who was that brave girl so sweet?”
    I covered the crushed broken body and said
    "That bad girl down the street.”

    A tongue can accuse and carry bad news
    The seeds of destruction were sown
    So unless you have made no mistakes in your life
    Be careful of stones that you, you throw.
