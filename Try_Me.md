Written by Bob Dylan  
Recorded by Bob Dylan and The Band in the Basement, Summer 1967  
Tabbed by Eyolf Ã˜strem

I warn you: after the two first lines, the lyrics don't make any sense
at all. The only reason I've bothered tabbing this, is that the tune is
interesting.

Capo 3rd (or 2nd) fret

    F
    . . .
        Am
    Try me
        C
    Try me, little girl,
             G           C
    We could raise a family

              C
    Well they treat you like a dummy,

    well they treat you like a slave

    Nothin' bout what you said, it's all

    what you gave

        F
    Try me
        Am
    Try me
        C
    Try me, little girl,
             G           C
    We could raise a family

               C
    Well, they treat so low
            F                     C
    [at the time I'll ring out of way]
    C         Dm        Em            F         G
    [Oh, nika tho nika, three's gotta you gonna way]
                  C
    Oh, well it's three in the morning,
