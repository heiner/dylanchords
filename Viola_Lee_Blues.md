    G
     The judge decreed it, the clerk he wrote it

    The clerk he wrote it down indeedy *)
    C                                            G
     The judge decreed it, the clerk he wrote it down
             D                   C                   G
    Give you this jail sentence, you'll be Nashville bound

    Some got six months, some got one solid
    Some got one solid year, indeedy
    Some got six months, some got one solid year
    But me and my buddy both got lifetime here

    Fix my supper mama, I wanna go to
    I wanna go to bed indeed Lord
    Fix my supper, I wanna go to bed
    I've been drinking White Lightning, And it's gone to my head

\*) Dylan actually sings “The judge decreed it down indeedy” here.
