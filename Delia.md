Traditional, arranged by Bob Dylan  
Released on [World Gone Wrong](/wiki/World Gone Wrong "wikilink") (1993)  
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

Read [John Garst's story about Delia
Green](http://dylanchords.info/36_wgw/ballad_of_delia_green.htm), age
14, shot down on Christmas Eve 1900 by her boyfriend “Cooney” Houston.

Capo 2nd fret (original key D major)

Chords:

    C      x32013  in the intro,otherwise x32010
    F9     xx3213  in the intro, otherwise normal F
    Cviii  xxx988
    Fv     xxx565
    Ciii   xxx553
    Giii   xxx433
    C/g    332010

It should be mentioned that Dylan isn't always dead certain about
neither how long to strum F before “all the friends I ever had are
gone”, nor about now to play the descending riff. But hey, he's an
artist, man, you gotta give him that.

If your pinky is strong enough, I'd suggest to play the figure in the
second line as a half-barre on the eight fret with the middle finger on
the ninth, then let that slide down to form the basis of the "D-shape"
chord on the fifth fret, with the rest of the strings fingered with the
ring- and little fingers. That way, it's possible to play it quickly and
smoothly. At least that's how I play it.

        All the friends I ever had are gone.

    Delia's dear ol' mother took a trip out West
    When she returned, little Delia'd gone to rest.
    All the friends I ever had are gone.

    Delia's Daddy weeped, Delia's momma moaned
    Wouldn't have been so bad if the poor girl died at home.
    All the friends I ever had are gone.

    Curtis's looking high, Curtis's looking low
    He shot poor Delia down with a cruel forty-four.
    All the friends I ever had are gone.

    High upon the housetops, high as I can see
    Looking for them rounders, looking out for me.
    All the friends I ever had are gone

    Men in Atlanta, trying to pass for white
    Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet out of sight.
    All the friends I ever had are gone.

    Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
    "All about them rounders, Judge, tryin' to cut me out."
    All the friends I ever had are gone.

    Curtis said to the judge "What might be my fine?"
    Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
    All the friends I ever had are gone.

    Curtis' in the jailhouse, drinking from an old tin cup
    Delia's in the graveyard, she ain't gettin' up.
    All the friends I ever had are gone.

    Delia, oh Delia, how can it be?
    You loved all them rounders, never did love me.
    All the friends I ever had are gone.

    Delia, oh Delia, how could it be?
    You wanted all them rounders, never had time for me.
    All the friends I ever had are gone.
