Tenderly William kissed his wife.

Then he opened her head with a butcher's knife.

<h3>Spoken version</h3>

This version of the text is recited after the song in one of the
circulating snippets. I don’t know who reads them or who wrote them;
they seem to be the “Captain Subtext” version.

Tenderly William kissed his wife.<br>
Her ... were white on the kitchen knife

Lady Margaret's pillow was wet with tears.<br>
No one has fucked her in twenty years.

The doctor gave Sally a sad surprise,<br>
a thalidomide baby with no eyes.

Little Billy Brown will shake with fright.<br>
He has a new uncle – every night.

My father has cancer, my mother’s insane<br>
The girl I’m in love with takes cocaine

When will the swan begin to sing?<br>
I am weary of everything.
