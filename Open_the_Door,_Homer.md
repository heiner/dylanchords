Words and music Bob Dylan  
Released on [The Basement Tapes](/wiki/The Basement Tapes "wikilink")
(1967/1975)  
Tabbed by Eyolf Ã˜strem

Capo 3rd fret (sounding key Bb major)

    G

                   G
    Now, there's a certain thing
           Em
    That I learned from Jim
    G                                   D
    That he'd always make sure I'd understand
        G
    And that is that there's a certain way
    Em
     we all must swim
            C
    If we expect to live off
                      D
    Of the fat of the land.

             Am
    Open the door, Rachel [Richard?],

    I've heard it said before.

    Open the door, Rachel,

    I've heard it said before
          C                           G
    But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.

    Now, there's a certain thing
    That I learned from my friend, Mouse
    A fella who never blushes
    And that is that one must always
    flush out his house
    If he don't expect to be housing flushes.

    Chorus

    "Take care of all your memories"
    Said Mick
    "For you cannot relive them
    And remember when you're out there
    Tryin' to heal the sick
    That you must always
    First forgive them."

    Chorus
