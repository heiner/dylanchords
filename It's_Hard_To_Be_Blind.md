Minnesota Party Tape II (May 1961)

</h2>
Capo 2nd fret (sounding key D major)

The guitar accompaniment has a fairly steady oompa-bass, as exemplified
in the tab snipped below.  
The F is frequently played with the little flourish in the second
measure below (indicated with an asterisk in the chord section).  
There are instrumental verses before, between, and after, which are more
or less identical to the tabbed version.

This version is much more straightforward in the playing.  
Capo 1st fret (sounding key Db major)

“I wrote my own new song to it, it's called “It's hard it's hard to be
poor. But I'll sing it [Gary's way]”

            C         F          C
    Lord, I cried the day I went blind

    Nobody cares about me.
        C      F       G      C
    And nobody cares about me.

    Lord, it's hard and it's hard to be blind
    And it's hard and it's hard to be blind
    If I could see, how happy I would be
    Nobody cares about me.
    Nobody cares about me.

    There was a time when I went blind
    Lord what's happened to me?
