“Everybody here knows about Stevie, so . . .  
This is for Stevie, wherever you are, Stevie”

    C    Am    F            Em
    Moon River wider than a mile
        F               Em        Dm7    G
    I'm crossing you in style someday
            Am    C          F     Em
    All the dream makers, you heartbreaker
        C           B7        Em         Dm7   G  (G11)
    Wherever you're going I'm going your way
    C   Am       F              Em
    Two drifters off to see the world
           F          Em   Dm7   G
    Such a lovely world to see
          Am        /g#  C/g Dm
    We're after the same rainbows
    Em  F                 Em
    And waiting round the bend
       F           Em
    My huckleberry friend,
    Am   Dm7
    Moon River
    G    C
     And me

       C           G7             C
       :   .   .   :   .   .
