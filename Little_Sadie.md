<pre class="verse">
     A
Went out last night to take a little round.
  G
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down.
  A
I ran right home and I went to bed
       G     [n.c.]                  A
With a forty-four smokeless under my head.

I began to think what a deed I'd done,
I grabbed my hat and away I run.
I made a god run but I run too slow;
They overtook me down in Jericho

Standing on a corner ringin' my bell,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville.
He said "Young man is you name Brown?
Remember the night you blowed Little Sadie down."

"Oh, yes sir, my name is Lee.
I murdered little Sadie in the first degree.
First degree and second degree,
If you've got any papers will you serve them to me?"

Well they took me down town and they dressed me in black.
They put me on a train and they brought me back.
I had no one for to go my bail;
They crammed me back into the county jail.

The judge and the jury they took their stand.
The judge had the papers in his hand.
Forty-one days, forty-one nights;
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes.
