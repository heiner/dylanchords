    G                                  C
    Doctor, doctor tell me the time of day!
    G
    Another bottle's empty, another penny spent.
    G                                  C
    He turned around and he slowly walked away.
    C                                G
    They shot him in the back and down he went.

    C
    Shine your light
    D
    Movin' on
    C
    You burned so bright
    G
    Roll on, John

    From the Liverpool docks to the red-light Hamburg streets,
    Down in the quarry with the Quarrymen
    Playing to the big crowds, playing to the cheap seats.
    Another day in the life on your way to your journey's end.

    Shine your light,
    Movin' on
    You burned so bright
    Roll on, John

    Sailin' through the trade winds bound for the South
    Rags on your back just like any other slave.
    They tied your hands and they clamped your mouth.
    Wasn't no way out of that deep dark cave.

    Shine your light
    Movin' on
    You burned so bright
    Roll on, John

    I heard the news today, oh boy
    They hauled your ship up on the shore
    Now the city gone dark, there is no more joy.
    They tore the heart right out and cut him to the core.

    Shine your light
    Movin' on
    You burned so bright
    Roll on, John

    Put on your bags and get 'em packed.
    Leave right now, you won't be far from wrong.
    The sooner you go the quicker you'll be back.
    You've been cooped up on an island far too long.

    Shine your light
    Movin' on
    You burned so bright
    Roll on, John

    Slow down you're moving way too fast,
    Come together right now over me.
    Your bones are weary, you're about to breathe your last.
    Lord, you know how hard it can be!

    Shine your light
    Movin' on
    You burned so bright
    Roll on, John

    Roll on, John, roll through the rain and snow.
    Take the right-hand road and go where the buffalos roam.
    They'll trap you in an ambush before you know.
    Too late now to sail back home.

    Shine your light
    Movin' on
    You burned so bright
    Roll on, John
