    Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home
        C                                                   G
    And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hear my milk cow moan
                                           B7/f#           C/g
    And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit the highway road
              G               D            G          C
    But then again, but then again, I said oh, I said oh, I said
    G        D                     G
    Oh babe, I'm in the mood for you.

    Sometimes I'm in the mood, Lord, I had my overflowin' fill
    Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna make out my final will
    Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna head for the walkin' hill
    But then again, but then again, I said oh, I said oh, I said
    Oh babe, I'm in the mood for you.

    Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna lay right down and die
    Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna climb up to the sky
    Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna laugh until I cry
    But then again, I said again, I said again, I said
    Oh babe, I'm in the mood for you.

    Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna sleep in my pony's stall
    Sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothin' at all
    Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna fly like a cannon ball
    But then again, but then again, I said oh, I said oh, I said
    Oh babe, I'm in the mood for you.

    Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna back up against the wall
    Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna run till I have to crawl
    Sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothin' at all
    But then again, but then again, I said oh, I said oh, I said
    Oh babe, I'm in the mood for you.

    Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change my house around
    Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna make a change in this here town
    Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna change the world around
    But then again, but then again, I said oh, I said oh, I said
    Oh babe, I'm in the mood for you.
