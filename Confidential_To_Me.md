    To look into your heart?

    Confidential as a church in twilight
    Sacred and moving as a rose in moonlight
    My love for you will always be
    Confidential to me

    Our love is a precious secret
    Too beautiful to share
    what need have I
    for crying eyes
    To look into my heart?

    Confidential as a rose in moonlight
    Sacred and moving as a church in twilight
    My love for you will always be
    Confidential to me
