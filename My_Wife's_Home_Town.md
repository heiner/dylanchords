D throughout, with shades of D minor. The guitar/accordeon riff below is
played at the end (or is it beginning?) of most measures, and that’s
more or less it, except for the ‘Home Town’ motif, given here as a
one-guitar thing, but played on different instruments. I wouldn’t
necessarily say that it’s a good idea to play this arrangement on a
single guitar, but it’s up to you.

N.C. = "no chord"; the slash chords ("/d" etc) indicate bass notes.

    I just wanna say that hell’s my wife’s home town

    Well there’s reasons for that, and reasons for this
    I can’t think of any just now, but I know they exist
    I’m sittin in the sun âtill my skin turns brown
    I just wanna say that hell’s my wife’s home town home town home town

    She can make you steal, make you rob
    Give you the hives, make you lose your job
    Make things bad she can make things worse
    She got stuff more potent than a gypsy curse

    One of these days I’ll end up on the run
    I'm pretty sure she'll make me kill someone
    I’m going inside, roll the shutters down
    I just wanna say that hell’s my wife’s home town

    Well there’s plenty to remember, plenty to forget
    I still can remember the day we met
    I lost my reasons long ago
    My love for her is all I know

    State gone broke, the county's dry
    Don't be lookin' at me with that evil eye
    Keep on walking, don’t be hanging around
    I’m tellin you again that hell’s my wife’s home town

    home town
    home town
