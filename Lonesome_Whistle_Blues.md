          C
    I was riding number 9,
            F          C
    heading south from Carolina.
                    G               C
    I heard that lo-onesome whistle blow.

    Got in trouble, had to roam,
            F             C
    left my girl, left my home.
                    G               C
    I heard that lo-onesome whistle blow.

           F
    Just a kid, acting smart,
               C
    I went and broke my baby's heart.
                  D            G
    I guess I was too young to know.
                 C
    They took me off that Georgia Main
                  F             C
    and locked me to a ball and chain.
                    G               C
    I heard that lo-onesome whistle blow.

    All I do is sit and cry
    as the evening train goes by.
    I heard that lonesome whistle blow.
    I'll be locked here in this cell
    till my body's just a shell
    and my head turns whiter than snow.
    I'll never see that girl of mine
    'cos I'm in Georgia doing time.
    I heard that lonesome whistle blow.

    I'll be locked here in this cell
    till my body's just a shell
    and my head turns whiter than snow.
    I'll never see that girl of mine
    'cos I'm in Georgia doing time.
    I heard that lonesome whistle blow.
