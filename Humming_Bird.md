John and Jack Anglin<br>
Played by Bob Dylan during the summer tour 2001 (as sung in Anzio, Jul 24)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Ã˜strem

I've indicated the length of the phrases, as they are somewhat irregular. <br>
I've only partly been able to decipher the lyrics of Dylan's version, which differ
considerably from Jim & Jack's. His second verse is some of the most unintelligible
singing I've ever heard from Dylan. [http://dylanchords.info/mail.htm Any clues, anyone?]

Headin' for the South

The bluegrass of old Kentucky

Brought my heart into my mouth

I've been east I've been west

But now I'm goin' home
                                   
As the rollin' wheels beat polished steel
  F#              B 
I sing this happy song</pre>

Hummin' bird
Keep hummin'
I love to hear your
Lonesome whistle whine
Hummin' bird
Keep hummin'
I'm ridin' to
The end of the line</pre>
