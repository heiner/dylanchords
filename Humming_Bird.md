John and Jack Anglin  
Played by Bob Dylan during the summer tour 2001 (as sung in Anzio, Jul
24)  
Tabbed by Eyolf Ã˜strem

I've indicated the length of the phrases, as they are somewhat
irregular.  
I've only partly been able to decipher the lyrics of Dylan's version,
which differ considerably from Jim & Jack's. His second verse is some of
the most unintelligible singing I've ever heard from Dylan. [Any clues,
anyone?](http://dylanchords.info/mail.htm)

    Way down bluegrass state

Jim and Jack Anglin's version:

</h2>
    E

    Humming bird
         B
    Keep hummin'
              F#
    I love to hear
                          B
    Your lonesome whistle whine
            E
    Hummin' bird
         B
    Keep hummin'
        F#                       B
    I'm ridin' to the end of the line

    B
    Leavin' Cincinnati,
    E               B
    Headin' for the South

    The bluegrass of old Kentucky
               F#            B
    Brought my heart into my mouth
    B
    I've been east I've been west
        E             B
    But now I'm goin' home

    As the rollin' wheels beat polished steel
      F#              B
    I sing this happy song

    Hummin' bird
    Keep hummin'
    I love to hear your
    Lonesome whistle whine
    Hummin' bird
    Keep hummin'
    I'm ridin' to
    The end of the line
