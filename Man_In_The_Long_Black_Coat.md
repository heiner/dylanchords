    F#m          A             E        C#m
    Crickets are chirpin', the water is high,
              F#m         A            E            F#m
    There's a soft cotton dress on the line hangin' dry.
    F#m         A     E       C#m
    Window wide open, African trees
    F#m       A                E         F#m
    Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze.
          E
    Not a word of goodbye, not even a note
        F#m           A          E          F#m
    She gone with the man in the long black coat.

    Somebody seen him hangin' around
    At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town.
    He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
    If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask.
    Somebody said from the bible he'd quote
    There was dust on the man in the long black coat.

    Preacher was talking, there's a sermon he gave
    He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved
    You cannot depend on it to be your guide
    When it's you who must keep it satisfied
    It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat
    She gave her heart to the man in the long black coat.

          D                       A
    There are no mistakes in life some people say
          F#m                    E           F#m
    It is true sometimes you can see it that way
        D                        A
    But people don't live or die people just float
        F#m           A          E          F#m
    She went with the man in the long black coat.

    There's smoke on the water, it's been there since June
    Tree trunks unprooted 'neath the high crescent moon
    Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force
    Somebody is out there beating on a dead horse
    She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote
    She gone with the man in the long black coat.
