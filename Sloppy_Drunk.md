Written by David Bromberg  
Recorded by Bob Dylan during the Bromberg Sessions, early/mid June
1992  
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem (thanks to esmith for corrections and details)

The song is frequently ascribed to Jimmy Rogers (the bluesman, not the
country artist Jimmie Rodgers), because of his song of the same title
(which again has taken some “inspiration” (whatever that means in the
blues world) from Sonny Boy Williamson I and his “Sloppy Drunk Blues”),
but Bromberg is registered as the copyright holder (thanks to Alan
Fraser for notifying me), and apart from the title, the two songs have
little in common.

The Eb7 in the turnaround could be played xx1323, x6564x, or, simpler,
and perhaps even more correctly, xx1003.

    Well, look here Firmin,*) god knows, you're a mess
    Folks that say they don't drink no more, I know they don't drink no less
    Well, my good friend Firmin over there, aah, he's a mess
    Well, he says he don't drink no more, I know he don't drink no less

    Well, I'm leavin' town, baby, go on pack my trunk
    I got no good bourbon, got no, but this blues got me sloppy drunk

    I never touch no whiskey, but the blues, great god! got me sloppy drunk
