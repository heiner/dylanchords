    G              C
    Some old lady, in this town.
          G                D       G
    Keeps telling all them lies on me.
    G          G7            C
    Wish to my soul that old lady would die.
         G                D       G
    Stop telling all them lies on me.

    D                    G
    Oh babe, it ain't no lie.
    B7                   C
    Oh babe, it ain't no lie.
                         G
    Oh babe, it ain't no lie.
                D              G
    this life I lead is mighty high.

    Been all around this whole wide world
    Honey babe I just got back today
    I've been saving all of my love for you
    Honey baby what more can I do

    Oh babe, it ain't no lie (etc.)
