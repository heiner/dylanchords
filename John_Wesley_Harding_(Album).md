Introductory remarks

</h2>
<h3>
Eyolf Østrem

</h3>
There are three general remarks to be made about this album. One is the
consistent use of the capo. Several of the songs ([John Wesley
Harding](John Wesley Harding), [All Along the
Watchtower](All Along the Watchtower), [The Ballad of Frankie
Lee and Judas
Priest](The Ballad of Frankie Lee and Judas Priest), [As I
Went Out One Morning](As I Went Out One Morning), [I Pity the
Poor Immigrant](I Pity the Poor Immigrant)), are played with
the capo around the 5th fret, which produces the high, ringing guitar
sound that is so typical of this album (if it’s successful is another
question: it also creates a very thin, open sound-scape, with the bass
and the guitar far removed from eachother and from the drums – they all
stand very much alone; maybe he should have gone back to the studio and
added some tracks with the Band as he originally planned).

The other is the very simple chord progressions in many of the songs
([The Ballad of Frankie Lee and Judas
Priest](The Ballad of Frankie Lee and Judas Priest),
[Drifter's Escape](Drifter's Escape), [The Wicked
Messenger](The Wicked Messenger), not to mention [All Along
the Watchtower](All Along the Watchtower)). That these songs
nevertheless stand out as some of the most effective on the album is a
testimony of Dylan’s superb singing on this album.

His harmonica work is also outstanding. A year of wild touring with the
Band may have come close to killing him, but his harp playing certainly
became more expressive – and this is the only album where it shows
directly, IMHO.

One song stands out – in the negative sense: the [John Wesley
Harding](John Wesley Harding). It was what kept me from
buying the record for several years.
