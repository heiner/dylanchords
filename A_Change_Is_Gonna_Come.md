Written by Sam Cooke <br>
Performed live by Bob Dylan at the 70th anniversary celebration show at the Apollo Theatre, NY <br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Ã˜strem

----
Capo 1st fret (sounding key C# major)

See tab for chord shapes

The song is played higher up on the neck, and instead of the first-position version below, you can use a capo on the 6th fret and the alternative chords further down on the page. The intro can actually be played fairly comfortably on a single guitar an octave lower than played, as notated:

      C
I was born by the river, in a little tent,
Dm                                     Am
 just like the river I've been running   ever since
(G/b)            C                 Dm            F   E7
     It's been a long, a long time coming, but I know

A change is gonna come, oh yes it will

It's been too hard living, but I'm afraid to die
I don't know what's up there beyond the sky,
It's been a long time coming, but I know
A change is gonna come, oh yes it will

I go to the movie and I go downtown
Somebody always tellin' me: don't hang around
It's been a long, a long time coming, but I know
A change is gonna come, oh yes it will

<pre class="bridge">Dm
  Now I go
          Am
to see my brother

I say brother,
           Am
help me please
       Dm
But he wind up
           Am
a-knocking me

back down on my knees</pre>

There been times that I thought I couldn't last for long
Now I think I'm able to carry on
It's been a long, a long time coming, but I know
A change is gonna come, oh yes it will</pre>
