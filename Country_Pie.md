* * * * *

    A    /c#      D
    Just like old Saxophone Joe
    F#m                        Bm
    When he's got the hogshead up on his toe
    A  /c#    F#7
    Oh me, oh my
    Bm        E       A
    Love that country pie

    Listen to the fiddler play
    When he's playin' 'til the break of day
    Oh me, oh my
    Love that country pie

    C#7
    Raspberry, strawberry, lemon and lime
    F#
      What do I care?
    Bm
    Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin and plum
    E
    Call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there

    Saddle me up my big white goose
    Tie me on 'er and turn her loose
    Oh me, oh my
    Love that country pie

    I don't need much and that ain't no lie
    Ain't runnin' any race
    Give to me my country pie
    I won't throw it up in anybody's face

    Shake me up that old peach tree
    Little Jack Horner's got nothin' on me
    Oh me, oh my
    Love that country pie
