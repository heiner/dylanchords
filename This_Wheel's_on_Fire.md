            Am
    If your mem'ry serves you well,
                     Bdim
    We were goin' to meet again and wait,
           E
    So I'm goin' to unpack all my things
        Dm           (F)       Am
    And sit before it gets too late.
       C              Am
    No man alive will come to you
           C               Am
    With another tale to tell,
            C                  Am
    And you know that we shall meet again
            Dm     F          Am
    If your mem'ry serves you well.

    Dm         F
    wheel's on fire,
    C                G
    Rolling down the road,
         C   G     F       C
    Best notify my next of kin,
    F          G       A
    This wheel shall explode!

    If your mem'ry serves you well,
    I was goin' to confiscate your lace,
    And wrap it up in a sailor's knot
    And hide it in your case.
    If I knew for sure that it was yours . . .
    But it was oh so hard to tell.
    But you knew that we would meet again,
    If your mem'ry serves you well.

    This wheel's on fire,
    Rolling down the road,
    Best notify my next of kin,
    This wheel shall explode!

    If your mem'ry serves you well,
    You'll remember you're the one
    That called on me to call on them
    To get you your favors done.
    And after ev'ry plan had failed
    And there was nothing more to tell,
    You knew that we would meet again,
    If your mem'ry served you well.

    This wheel's on fire,
    Rolling down the road,
    Best notify my next of kin,
    This wheel shall explode!
