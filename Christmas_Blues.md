Don't let the long names scare you off. Rule of thumb \#1: it will
rarely hurt to chop off from the end (e.g. E7-9 is just a spiced-up E7).
Rule of thumb \#2: a plain 7 or m7 will usually work just fine.

        Dmaj7            Em7
    The jingle bells are jingling
        Dmaj7                  A7+9
    The streets are white with snow
        Dmaj7 Em7        F#m7 G
    The happy crowds are mingling
                D7
    But there's no one that I know
        G9
    I'm sure that you'll forgive me
    D7   C7        B7
    If I don't enthuse
      E7-9               A7        F#7   B7  E7  A7
    I guess I've got the Christmas blues

    I've done my window shopping
    There's not a store I've missed
    But what's the use of stopping
    When there's no one on your list
    You'll know the way I'm feeling
    When you love and you lose
      E7-9               A7        D7
    I guess I've got the Christmas blues

    F#m7          B9
    When somebody wants you
    F#m7          B9
    Somebody needs you
    Em7            C      Em6
    Christmas is a joy of joy
        G#m7                C#9
    But friends when you're lonely
           G#m7            C#9
    You'll find that it's only
      F#m7             B9
    A thing for little girls
    Em7           A7
     and little boys

    May all your days be merry
    Your seasons full of cheer
    But 'til it's January
    I'll just go and disappear
    Oh Santa may have brought you some stars for your shoes
    But Santa only brought me the blues
          E7-9
    Those brightly packaged tinsel covered
    A7/6         D . . . | G7-9 . F#7-9 . | B7+9 . E7 . | A7sus4 . A7
       Christmas blues

    [First half of verse instrumental]

    Oh Santa may have brought you some stars for your shoes
    But Santa only brought me the blues
    Those brightly packaged tinsel covered

    Christmas blues
