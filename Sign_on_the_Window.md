Words and music Bob Dylan  
Released on [New Morning](New Morning) (1970)  
Tabbed by Eyolf Ã˜strem

Piano song - in F\# major, possibly the worst conceivable guitar key. I
suggest a capo on the 2nd fret and the following chords:

    Asus2      002200
    E/b        x<strong>2</strong>2100
    E/a        x<strong>0</strong>2100
    E/g#       422100 or 476454
    F#m7       242222
    F#9        242324
    F#m/a      x<strong>0</strong>4222

    Her and her boyfriend went to California,
    Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune.
    My best friend said, "Now didn' I warn ya,
    Brighton girls are like the moon,
    Brighton girls are like the moon."

    Build me a cabin in Utah,
    Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
    Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa,"
    That must be what it's all about,
    That must be what it's all about.

I accidentally tabbed this one with my guitar tuned down one half tone
-- and that happens to work quite well.
