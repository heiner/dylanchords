    A       (A7)
    Look who's back in town

    Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown
    D7
    All you boys better run for cover
           E
    If you don't a-wanna be a broken hearted lover.

    A
    See her in that very tight skirt

    Got what it takes just to make you hurt
    D7
    Don't be deceived by those big bright eyes
              E
    Prefer to treat her nasty and low down lies.

    D
    Makes no difference where she's been
    A
    I know Sal's been doin' them things again
    D
    Breaking hearts up and down the line
        E
    Like she broke this heart of mine.

    A
    I'll go see them come down my way

    Like a fool you're gonna hear me say:
          D7
    "I'll lay at your bed Sally Sue Brown
    E                                              A
    Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down".

    Makes no difference where she's been
    I'm go in south and doin' them things again
    Bake in a hot tub, down the line
    I'd rather see you ruin this a-heart of mine.

    I'll go see them come down my way
    Like a fool you're gonna hear me say:
    "I'll lay at your bed Sally Sue Brown
    Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down".
