    A
              C   D   A
    Well, I'm hangin' on
         C D   A
    to a solid rock
    D E F#m
    Made
    D E F#m
    before
        D E F#m
    the foundation
    D E F#m
    of
        A
    the world
          D
    And I won't let go, and I can't let go, won't let go
                                                            A
    And I can't let go, won't let go, and I can't let go no more.

         C  D      A              C  D      A
    For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
         C     D     A           E
    For me he was rejected by a world that He created.
    C  D        A      C      D   A
    Nations are angry, cursed are some,
    C      D      A        E
    People are expecting a false peace to come.

              G       A
    Well I'm hangin' on ...

    It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
    Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it
    Using all the devices under the sun.
    And He never give up 'til the battle's lost or won.
