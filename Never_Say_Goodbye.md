    D        G            A
    Twilight on the frozen lake
          G             D
    North wind about to break
       G                A
    On footprints in the snow
    G            D     G  A  G
    Silence down below.

           G  C             D
    You're beautiful beyond words
           C           G
    You're beautiful to me
    C               D
    You can make me cry
    C         G      C  D  C
    Never say goodbye.

    My dreams are made of iron and steel
    With a big bouquet
    Of roses hanging down
    From the heavens to the ground.

    The crashing waves roll over me
    As I stand upon the sand
    Wait for you to come
    And grab hold of my hand.

    (chaos...)

    Oh baby baby baby blue
    You've changed you last name, too
    You've turned your hair to brown
    Love to see it hangin' down.
