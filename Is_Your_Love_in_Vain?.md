One verse instrumental intro

           C    /b  Am  C/g
    Do you love me,
           F                      G    Gsus4 G
    or are you just extending goodwill?
           C       /b      Am         C/g
    Do you need me half as bad as you say,
           F                G      C/g G
    or are you just feeling guilt?
              Am       G(6)       F        C
    I've been burned before and I know the score
           F                G    Gsus4 G
    So you won't hear me complain.
    C         /b      Am       C/g
    Will I be able to count on you
       F       G       C    Csus4 C
    Or is your love in vain?

    Are you so fast that you cannot see
    that I must have solitude?
    When I am in the darkness,
    why do you intrude?
    Do you know my world, do you know my kind
    Or must I explain?
    Will you let me be myself
    Or is your love in vain?

              F           G                 C    /b     Am
    Well I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
              F             G    C
    I've been in and out of happiness.
           F          G                C /b    Am
    I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings
             F                G
    And I've never been too impressed.

    All right, I'll take a chance,
    I will fall in love with you
    If I'm a fool you can have the night,
    you can have the morning too.
    Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow,
    Do you understand my pain?
    Are you willing to risk it all
    Or is your love in vain?
