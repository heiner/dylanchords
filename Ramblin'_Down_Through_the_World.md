<pre class="verse">
      G                      Em
Well, I'm just-a one of them ramblin' boys,
C                  D      G
Ramblin' round and makin' noise
G                 Em
Sometimes lonely, sometimes blue,
C              D           G
Noone knows it better than you
</pre>

<pre class="refrain">
Ramlin' round ramblin' twirl,
Ramblin' down through the world
Ramlin' down ramblin' twirl,
Ramblin' down through the world
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
[long harp solo over sustained D/f# chord, then some rounds of the verse]
