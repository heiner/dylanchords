          G                      Em
    Well, I'm just-a one of them ramblin' boys,
    C                  D      G
    Ramblin' round and makin' noise
    G                 Em
    Sometimes lonely, sometimes blue,
    C              D           G
    Noone knows it better than you

    Ramlin' round ramblin' twirl,
    Ramblin' down through the world
    Ramlin' down ramblin' twirl,
    Ramblin' down through the world

    [long harp solo over sustained D/f# chord, then some rounds of the verse]
