Dm, or as a combination of the two: both xx3130 and xx0111 ar possible
alternatives.

The lyrics differ somewhat from Ricky Nelson's, on minor points (such
as the change of “In the town of broken dreams” to “There's a town
. . .”).

<pre class="verse">
C              E
There's a place where lovers go
F            G(11)     C     (/d-e)
To cry their troubles away,
F        (Dm)    C        Am
And they call it lonesome town,
Dm        G(11)         C     G(11)
Where the broken hearts stay.

You can buy a dream or two
To last you all through the years,
And the only price you pay
Is a heart full of tears.

<pre class="bridge">
F             Em
Goin' down to lonesome town
Dm                      C   (/d-e)
Where the broken hearts stay,
F             Em
Maybe down in lonesome town
     D7              G(11)
I'll cry my troubles away.
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
There's a place of broken dreams
Every streets is filled with regret.
Maybe down in lonesome town
I can learn to forget.
