The “(Dm)” in the third line could be played both as an Fm or as a Dm,
or as a combination of the two: both xx3130 and xx0111 ar possible
alternatives.

    G11     3x3211

The lyrics differ somewhat from Ricky Nelson's, on minor points (such as
the change of “In the town of broken dreams” to “There's a town . . .”).

    C              E
    There's a place where lovers go
    F            G(11)     C     (/d-e)
    To cry their troubles away,
    F        (Dm)    C        Am
    And they call it lonesome town,
    Dm        G(11)         C     G(11)
    Where the broken hearts stay.

    You can buy a dream or two
    To last you all through the years,
    And the only price you pay
    Is a heart full of tears.

    F             Em
    Goin' down to lonesome town
    Dm                      C   (/d-e)
    Where the broken hearts stay,
    F             Em
    Maybe down in lonesome town
         D7              G(11)
    I'll cry my troubles away.

    There's a place of broken dreams
    Every streets is filled with regret.
    Maybe down in lonesome town
    I can learn to forget.
