Written by Bob Dylan<br>
Performed live by Dylan in Toronto, April 19, 1980<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Ã˜strem. Lyric transcription leans heavily on
discussions at [pool.dylantree.com pool.dylantree.com]

----
Capo 1st fret (sounding key Db major)

It varies somewhat what is the first bass tone in each bar in the
refrain, C or D. In the introduction, it leans more towards C, but
after the verses, where it is prepared by the A chord, it is more
unequivocally a D, as the root in a Dm7 chord. The second measure of
the tab below is a suggestion of how to get both, without loosing too
much of any of them.

I welcome corrections additions and suggestions to the lyrics.

 He came [on East out of] Galilee
    F            G            C
And disappeared [like when he taught]
Dm7             C/e
 He came down onto his own
F                G
His own knew him not
A
 But as for me,

<pre class="verse">
[He said when the fig tree was blooming]
He would be at the gate
He was talking 'bout the state of Israel
From nineteen fourty-eight
And the time is near, and

<pre class="verse">
When He was down conceived [here]
His mother didn't know what she carried
Took an angel of the lord
to tell her what she done carry
Carry for all mankind, that

Did anybody say it was gonna be easy?
Eb      F                           G
 Nobody said, [but you] couldn't complain
    Eb         F                       C
The God of the world tried to drive me crazy
A
Even Peter denied Him

Standin' right beside Him

took Him out and falsely tried Him

Eventually crucified him
C                                 E
Who am I to say I wouldn't do the same?

[....] who repaired the roof
[tried to tilt] against the grain
When Herod found out that he was born
He had every boy child slain
Hey, let's all pray

I will love him
I will serve him
I will glorify His name        repeat
