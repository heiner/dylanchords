         G       C          G
    If I had someone that's true
             C                         G
    It would thrill me through and through
           G                             D
    I'd be happy, oh so happy, night and day
               G         C       G
    Seems each one got a perfect mate
            C              G
    But for me it's always late
           G                        D          G
    And it kills my soul to hear my sweetheart say:

        D
    Too late, to late
               C     G
    You're too late
         D
    I've waited oh so long,
            C              G
    But you never did come home.
            G       C/g  G
    Now you just go on alone,
    D          G
    You're too late

    I'll build my castles high
    Just to watch them fade and die
    Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever find a mate
    But I came looking o'er the hill
    for someone, and I always will
    But it just might be my fate to be too late

    Too late, to late
    You're too late
    I've waited oh so long,
    But you never did come home.
    Now you just go on alone,
    You're too late
