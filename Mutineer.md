Written by Warren Zevon  
Performed by Bob Dylan during the fall tour 2002  
Tabbed by Eyolf Ã˜strem

Below are two versions, with different capo positions. Since Zevon plays
the song with a keyboard arrangement, the chords are only suggestions.

Dylan is generally faithful to Zevon's version, with two small
exceptions: he drops the C\#m/g\# in the second line, and he simplifies
the bass run in the refrain lines to:

    E/g# - A - B - E

Capo 1st fret

    Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum

    A        B   E
    I'm your mutineer

    I was born to rock the boat
    Some may sink but we will float
    Grab your coat - let's get out of here
    You're my witness
