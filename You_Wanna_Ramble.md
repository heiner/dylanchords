                   A
    Well I told my baby

    I said Baby, I know where you been

    Well, I know who you are

    And what league you played in?
              D9
    You wanna ramble
                    A
    To the break of dawn
              D9
    You wanna ramble
                    A
    To the break of dawn
              E9     D9
    You wanna ramble
                    A
    To the break of dawn.

    Well, the night is so empty
    So quit and still
    For only fifteen hundred dollars
    You can have anybody killed
    You wanna ramble
    To the break of dawn
    You wanna ramble
    To the break of dawn
    You wanna ramble
    To the break of dawn.

    Well, I told my baby
    Further down the line
    I said, "What happens tomorrow
    Is on your head, not mine"
    You wanna ramble
    To the break of dawn
    You wanna ramble
    To the break of dawn
    You wanna ramble
    To the break of dawn.
