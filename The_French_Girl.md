Capo 2nd fret:

<pre class="refrain">
    D                     G
She laughed each time she called my name
     D           G
Made promises to meet a...

[no, let's, let's put it down in G]

No capo:

<pre class="bridge">
Am                          C          D
[Three silver rings] ... on slim hands waiting
                G     D/f#       C        Em    D
Flash bright in candlelight till Sunday's early morn
             Am        C     D
We found her room that rainy morning
            G            D/f#    C         Em     D
She took my hand through winding roads and led me home
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
Some red French wine when later wating
In her warm hideaway, she smiled and combed her hair
We talked of all, we talked of nothing
I left with promises to meet; she told me where.

    D                   G
She laughed each time I asked her name
     D           G
Made promises to meet again
        C            Em     D        G
But her friends down at the French caf
       Am                D
Had no English words for me
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
So you may find above the border
A girl with silver rings ...

[sudden stop]

you won't be the same
