    Who's on the table, who's to tell me? Oh yeah!
    Who should I tell, oh, who should I tell?
    The forty-nine in your burning hell
    Oh underneath that old apple suckling tree

    Under that apple suckling tree, Oh yeah!
    Under that apple suckling tree, Oh yeah!
    Underneath that tree
    There's just gonna be you and me
    Underneath that apple suckling tree, Oh yeah!

\*) Official lyrics. Dylan seems to sing something like: “there's other
place he ought to pay [...] brook, oh yeah”
