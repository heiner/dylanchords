        G               G+
    Go ahead, drive the nails through my hand
    C                     G
    Laugh at me where you stand.
    G                G+
    Go ahead, say it isn't me
            C                 G
    But the day will come and you will see.

                G  /f C/e
    'Cause I'll rise again
    D                 D11              G      (D)
    Ain't no power on earth can tie me down
              G  /f C/e
    Yes, I'll rise again
    D                   D11           G
    Death can't keep me buried in the ground.

    Go ahead, come on and mock my name
    My love for you is still the same
    Go ahead and try to bury me
    But very soon I will be free.

    'Cause I'll rise again
    Ain't no power on earth can tie me down
    Yes, I'll rise again
    Death can't keep me buried in the ground.

    Go ahead, say I'm dead and gone
    You will see that you were wrong.
    Go ahead, try to hide the sun
    And you all will see that I'm the one.

    'Cause I'll rise again
    Ain't no power on earth can tie me down
    Yes, I'll rise again
    Death can't keep me buried in the ground.

    'Cause I'll rise again
    Ain't no power on earth can tie me down
    Yes, I'll rise again
    Death can't keep me buried in the ground.
    Death can't keep me buried in the ground.
