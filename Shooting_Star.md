Words and music Bob Dylan.<br>
Released on [[Oh Mercy]] (1989) and in a live version on [[Unplugged]] (1995).<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

B” (in the bridge) is a chord with a whole lot of tones in it, on
several guitars, playing quite different chords. A good approximation
is x22324.

In the outtake version the song is clearly played in C, with a capo on
the 4th fret (see below). On ''[[Unplugged]]'' Dylan plays his licks
without a capo, while Jackson uses the capo on the 4th fret.

Seen a shooting star tonight
And I thought of me
If I was still the same If I ever became
what you wanted me to be
Did I miss the mark or overstep the line
that only you could see
Seen a shooting star tonight
And I thought of me.
