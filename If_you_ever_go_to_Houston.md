Words and music Bob Dylan  
Released on [Together Through Life](Together Through Life)
(2009)  
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

* * * * *

I decided to tab this relative to a capo on the first fret. The song is
in F major, which means that you'll have to play barre chords all the
way through. Feel free to do that instead, with the chords suggested at
the end of the tab.

Instead of the ‘slash chords', one can use sus4-chords (thus Esus4–E,
Asus4–A, and Dsus4–D).

                      G/d  D    G/d  D
    If you ever go to Houston
                      D/a  A    D/a  A
    Better walk right
                            A/e  E    A/e  E
    Keep your hands in your pockets
                         D/a  A    D/a  A
    And your gun-belt tight

    You'll be asking for trouble
    If you're lookin' for a fight
    If you ever go to Houston
    Boy, you better walk right

    If you're ever down there
    On Bagby and Lamar
    You better watch out for
    The man with the shining star
    Better know where you're going
    Or stay where you are
    If you're ever down there
    On Bagby and Lamar

    I know these streets
    I've been here before
    I nearly got killed here
    During the Mexican war
    Something always
    Keeps me coming back for more
    I know these streets
    I've been here before

    If you ever go to Dallas
    Say hello to Mary Anne
    Say I'm still pullin' on the trigger
    Hangin' on the best that I can
    If you see her sister Lucy
    Say I'm sorry I'm not there
    Tell her other sister Betsy
    To pray the sinner's prayer

    I got a restless fever
    Burnin' in my brain
    Got to keep ridin' forward
    Can't spoil the game
    The same way I leave here
    Will be the way that I came
    Got a restless fever
    Burnin' in my brain

    Mr. Policeman
    Can you help me find my gal
    Last time I saw her
    Was at the Magnolia Hotel
    If you help me find her
    You can be my pal
    Mr. Policeman
    Can you help me find my gal

    If you ever go to Austin
    Fort Worth or San Antone
    Find the bar rooms I got lost in
    And send my memories home
    Put my tears in a bottle
    Screw the top on tight
    If you ever go to Houston
    You better walk right
