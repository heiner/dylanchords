----
Dylan's performance is a tremendous one, but one where – as often is
the case with his one-offs – the words aren't always clear. I've
noted some deviations from the “standard” version, but not all of
them. The end of the chorus is sung differently, but I can't hear what
he's singing there. Thus, the version below is a hybrid: neither
exactly what Dylan sings, nor what he should have sung.

Either the tape is a little fast, or he has a capo on the 1st fret.

             C                  (Csus4-C)
Oh well, I'm tired and so weary,
      F           C
But I must travel on
         C              D7        G       C/g  G
Till the lord comes and takes me away,
         C
Well the morning's so bright
        F        C
And the lamp is alight
        C                  G            C       Csus4 C
And the night, night is as black as the sea *)

There will be peace in the valley

              C                   D7
There will be peace, peace in the valley

<pre class="verse">
Well the bear will be gentle
And the wolves will be tame
And the lion shall lie down by the lamb, oh yes ***)
And the beasts from on wild
they will be lit by a child
And I'll be changed from this creature that I am
</pre>

<pre class="refrain">
There will be peace in the valley for me, some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow
No trouble, trouble I see
There will be peace in the valley for me, for me

night as bright as the day.”

And the lion will lie down with the lamb”
