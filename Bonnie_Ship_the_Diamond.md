Trad.  
Played by Bob Dylan and the Band in the Basement of 1967  
Lyrics modified from It's not a house it's a home page. Chords tabbed by
Eyolf Ã˜strem

On my copy it plays in Bbm, thus a capo on the 1st fret.  
The chords in the first verse aren't quite like in the rest of the
verses, which follow the simpler pattern of the second verse.

    Am

              Am     C/g        D/f#
    Well, the bonnie ship was a good old ship
              Am                      E
    She was a-fishin' on a [leading chain]
        Am     /c            C/g
    And me an' John oh was a long catch[-on?]
               D/f#        F   E     Am
    It was the last of the ones I've seen

            Am          G       Am
    So with sword and a rope in bay
                                E
    Feel all that your heart be sailed
              Am     C/g      D/f#
    When that bonnie ship the Diamond goes
    Am      Em      Am
    fishin' for the whales.

             Am                  D
    Well, we feud all night, the cabin gauge,
             Am                E
    It was a-more than feelin' bad
             Am                  D
    And with all kind friends we watched in fear
             Am             Em   Am
    It was a naught time we ever had.

            Am   D     Am
    So it's rise up my lads
                          E
    Let your hearts never fail
              Am     C/g      D/f#
    When that bonnie ship the Diamond goes
    F       E       Am
    fishin' for the whales.

    An' all day long at Vera Cruz
    We sailed [all the likes] to bind
    With no heavy moan, any hearts [of stone]
    No aid was cried [tried?] for mine.

    So it's cheer up my boys
    Let your hearts never fail
    When that bonnie ship the Diamond
    Goes fishin' for the whales.

    Well, now along Cape Fate, 'twas lit in red
    All along cape Horn
    And from Vera Cruz we sailed ahead
    It was all in the time of storm.

    So, it's cheer on up my boys
    Let your hearts never fail
    When that bonnie ship the Diamond
    Goes fishin' for the whales.
