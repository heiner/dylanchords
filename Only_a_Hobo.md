    G                         C          G
    As I was out walking on a corner one day,
                                         D
    I spied an old hobo, in a doorway he lay.
        G                            C             G
    His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
                                        D              G
    And I guess he'd been there for the whole night or more.

    C                G
    Only a hobo, but one more is gone
                                   D   C' G/b
    Leavin' nobody to sing his sad song
    G                 C         G
    Leavin' nobody to carry him home
                            D        C' G
    He was only a hobo, but one more is gone

    A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
    As the curb was his pillow, the street was his bed.
    One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
    And a fistful of coins showed the money he bummed.

    Only a hobo, but one more is gone
    Leavin' nobody to sing his sad song
    Leavin' nobody to carry him home
    Only a hobo, but one more is gone

    Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
    To look up on the world from a hole in the ground,
    To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
    To lie in the gutter and die with no name?

    Only a hobo, but one more is gone
    Leavin' nobody to sing his sad song
    Leavin' nobody to carry him home
    Only a hobo, but one more is gone
