    Bb
    Go ahead and talk about him because he makes you doubt,

    Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without.

    Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,

    Remind him of what he used to be when he comes walkin' through.

             Gm    F     Eb
    He's the property of Jesus
      Gm       F      Eb
    Resent him to the bone
    Gm      F         Eb
    You got something better
                          Bb
    You've got a heart of stone

    Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
    Hope he falls upon himself, oh, won't that be sweet
    Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore
    Because he can't be bribed or bought by the things that you adore.

    He's the property of Jesus
    Resent him to the bone
    You got something better
    You've got a heart of stone

    When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
    Say he's hard-of-hearin', say that he's a chump.
    Say he's out of step with reality as you try to test his nerve
    Because he doesn't pay tribute to that king that you serve.

    He's the property of Jesus
    Resent him to the bone
    You got something better
    You've got a heart of stone

    Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense
    Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense.
    Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
    'Cause he doesn't tell you jokes or fairy tales, say he's failed to make you smile.

    He's the property of Jesus
    Resent him to the bone
    You got something better
    You've got a heart of stone

    You can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
    You think that when you rest at last you'll go back from where you came.
    But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb.
    What happened to the real you, you've been captured but by whom?

    He's the property of Jesus
    Resent him to the bone
    You got something better
    You've got a heart of stone
