    G

                 G          C           G
    The water is wide and I can't cross over
            Em              D
    Neither have I wings to fly
    [n.c.]     Bm                  C
    Build me a boat that can carry two
                   G  D            C G/b Am G (C/g G)
    And both shall row my love and I.

    There is a ship and it sails on the sea
    Loaded deep as deep can be
    But not as deep as the love I'm in
    I know not if I sink or swim.

    I leaned my back up against an oak
    Thinkin' it was a trusty tree
    But first it bent and then it broke
    Just like my own false love to me.

    Oh love is gentle, love is kind
    Gay as a jewel when first it's new
    But love grows old and waxes cold
    And fades away like some morning dew.

    The water is wide and I can't cross over
    Neither have I wings to fly
    Build me a boat that can carry two
    And both shall row my love and I.
