            C                        G/b       F/a
    Well, I wandered alone through a desert of stone
          C            G11    C
    And I dreamt of my future wife
       C                          F          C
    My sword's in my hand and I'm next in command
                                    F/a
    In this version of death called life           *)
    /b C                    F              C
    My plate and my cup are right straight up
                                     F/a
    I took a rose from the hand of a child
    /b     C                   G/b   F/a
    When I kiss your lips, the honey drips
              C               G11        C
    I'm gonna have to put you down for a while

    Every day we meet on any old street
    And you're in your girlish prime
    The short and the tall are coming to the ball
    I go there all the time
    Behind every tree there's something to  see
    The river is  wider than a mile
    I tried you twice, you can't be nice
    I'm gonna have to put you  down for a  while

    Here come the nurse with money in her purse
    Here come the ladies and men
    You push it all in, and you've no chance to win
    You play 'em on down to the end
    I'm laying in the sand getting a sunshine tan
    Moving along riding in style
    From my toes to my head you knock me dead
    I'm gonna have to put you down for a while

    I count the years and i shed no tears
    I'm blinded to what might have been
    Nature's voice makes my heart rejoice
    Play me the wild song of the wind
    I found hopeless love in the room above
    When the sun and the weather were one
    You're as fine as wine, I ain't handing you no line
    I'm gonna have to put you down for a while

    All the merry little elves can go hang themselves
    My faith is as cold as can be                           **)
    I'm stacked high to the roof, and I'm not without proof
    If you don't believe me, come see.
    You think i'm blue I think so too
    In my words you'll find no guile
    The game's gotten old The deck's gone cold
    And i'm gonna have to put you down for a while

    The game's gotten old The deck's gone cold
    I'm gonna have to put you down for a while

Letters", page 124: "if such a version of death can be called 'life.'"

cold as can be”. (the reference was communicated to me by Brad Sanders).
