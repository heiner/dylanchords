Words and music Bob Dylan  
Released on [Shot of Love](Shot of Love) (1981) and in a live
version on [Biograph](Biograph) (1985)  
 Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

This is a “piano song”, which means that it translates fairly badly to
an unaccompanied guitar. The easiest way to make the nice sixth--maj
seventh turns sound well, is to use a capo on the second fret and play D
- D6 - Dmaj7 - D6. The same turn can be played in B major as well, but
anyone who is able to *play* that, will also be able to find the chords
himself, so I didn't bother to write it out...  
It should be mentioned also that it suits open D/E tuning very well,
with the chords (labelled not by how they sound, but which chords they
correspond to in the tab):

    E     555555
    E6    575555
    Emaj7 595555
    B     000000
    E/b   020100
    B/f#  797877
    F#    777777

    Heart of mine.

    Heart of mine go back home,
    You got no reason to wander, you got no reason to roam.
    Don't let her see
    Don't let her see that you need her.
    Don't put yourself over the line
    Heart of mine.

    Heart of mine go back where you been,
    It'll only be trouble for you if you let her in.
    Don't let her hear you want her.
    Don't let her know she's so fine Heart of mine.

    Heart of mine you know that she'll never be true,
    She'll only give to others the love that she's gotten from you.
    Don't let her know
    Don't let her know where you're going.
    Don't untie the ties that bind
    Heart of mine.

    Heart of mine so malicious and so full of guile,
    Give you an inch and you'll take a mile.
    Don't let yourself fall
    Don't let yourself stumble.
    If you can't do the time, don't do the crime
    Heart of mine.
