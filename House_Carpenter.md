Dropped D tuning (D-A-d-g-b-e')

The chords, the little figures and the playing style is the same as in
numerous other dropped D-tunes from the early days. And as always, there
is some variation in the way the descent D - C9 - G/b is executed. Quite
often both in the C9 and in the G/b the bass tone is reached by a
hammer-on from the open 5th string.

In the third line there is some variation between the verses concerning
which bass tones are played. Some verses have the version of the
interlude written out below, with only C9 – others have the version of
the first verse.

Chords:

    D    000232
    C9   x30030 (actually Cadd9)
    G/b  x20030

    Well, if you could have married a King's daughter there
    I'm sure you're the one to blame
    For I am married to a house carpenter
    And I'm sure he's a fine young man

    Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
    And come away with me
    I'll take you to where the green grass grows
    On the shores of sunny Italy

    So up she picked her babies three
    And gave them kisses, one, two, three
    Saying "take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
    And keep him good company."

    Well, they were sailin' about two weeks
    I'm sure it was not three
    When the younger of the girls, she came on deck
    Sayin' she wants company

    "Well, are you weepin' for your house and home?
    Or are you weepin' for your babies three?"
    "Well, I'm not weepin' for my house carpenter
    I'm weepin' for my babies three."

    Oh what are those hills yonder, my love
    They look as white as snow
    Those are the hill of heaven, my love
    You and I'll never know

    Oh what are those hills yonder, my love
    They look as dark as night
    Those are the hills of hell-fire my love
    Where you and I will unite

    Oh twice around went the gallant ship
    I'm sure it was not three
    When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
    And it drifted to the bottom of the sea
