<pre class="verse">
G           Bm             C  (/b Am) G
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms
G              Em              C    G
You should not treat me like a stranger.
G          Bm                 C  (/b   Am) G
Our Father would not like the way that you act
G            Em          C  G
And you must realize the danger.

Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you
And one deserving of affection?
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
To love and follow His direction?
</pre>

<pre class="bridge">
F            C
We grew up together
         G
From the cradle to the grave
   F               C
We died and were reborn
            G         D      (/c-b-a)
And then mysteriously saved.
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
Time is an ocean but it ends at the shore
You may not see me tomorrow.

<pre class="verse">
C            Em             F           C
 Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms
G              Am              F    C
You should not treat me like a stranger.
C          Em                 F            C
Our Father would not like the way that you act
C            Am          F  C
And you must realize the danger.

<h2 class="songversion">Budokan version</h2>

The verses are sung over a sustained G minor chord. The only
difference is the bridge, which is played:

<pre class="bridge">
Bb           C
We grew up together
         Gm
From the cradle to the grave
   Bb              C
We died and were reborn
            Gm
And then mysteriously saved.
