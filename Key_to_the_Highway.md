----
These three verses (plus a fourth that I couldn't make out) were
played over and over again, in no particular order.

<pre class="verse">
          E          B
I got the key to the highway,
E                A
 I feel bound to go.
          E
I'm gonna leave here running;
B                   E
Walking is most too slow.

I'm going down to the border
Woman, where I'm better known.
Well you ain't done nothing but
drive a good man from his home.

Kiss me one, one time more mama
One time before I go,
When I leave this time I
won't be back no more.
</pre>
