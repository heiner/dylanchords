These three verses (plus a fourth that I couldn't make out) were played
over and over again, in no particular order.

              E          B
    I got the key to the highway,
    E                A
     I feel bound to go.
              E
    I'm gonna leave here running;
    B                   E
    Walking is most too slow.

    I'm going down to the border
    Woman, where I'm better known.
    Well you ain't done nothing but
    drive a good man from his home.

    Kiss me one, one time more mama
    One time before I go,
    When I leave this time I
    won't be back no more.
