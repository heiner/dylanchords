essay](http://dylanchords.info/professors/angelina_syrovy.htm) on this
song. Or read Michael Gray's analysis of this song, in his book *Song &
Dance Man III*.

As this is a “piano song”, it is played in C\# major (He prefers the
black keys on the piano). On a guitar I'd suggest a capo on the 1st fret
(chords of C major:F, C, G) or on the 4th fret (chords of A major:D, A,
E)

    C#

              F#                  C#
    Well it's always beenmy nature to take chances
    G#                                   C#
     My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances
    F#                                          C#
     Where the current is strong and the monkey dances
           G#
    To the tune of a concertina

    Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore
    I know what it is that has drawn me to your door
    But whatevercould it be makes you think you've seen me before
    Angelina

    F#    C#      G#
     Oooh-oh, Angelina
    F#    C#      G#
     Oooh-oh, Angelina

    His eyes were two slits make any snake proud
    With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
    Worshipping a god with the body of a woman well endowed
    And the head of a hyena

    Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek
    If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
    No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek
    Angelina

    Oooh-oh, Angelina
    Oooh-oh, Angelina

    In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode
    The peaches they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed
    I was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road
    With your subpoena

    When you cease to exist then who will you blame?
    I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game
    Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same
    Angelina

    Oooh-oh, Angelina
    Oooh-oh, Angelina

    There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone
    Your servants are half dead, you're down to the bone
    Tell me tall man, where would you like to be overthrown?
    In Jerusalem or Argentina?

    She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old
    Now her vengeance has been satisfied and her possessions have been sold
    He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold
    But so are you, Angelina

    Oooh-oh, Angelina
    Oooh-oh, Angelina

    I see pieces of men marching, tryin' to take heaven by force
    I can see the unknown rider, I can see the pale white horse
    In God's truth, name, tell me what you want and you'll have it of course
    Just step into the arena

    Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases
    Pass the tree of smoke, pass the angel with four faces
    Begging god for mercy and weeping in unholy places
    Angelina

    Oooh-oh, Angelina
    Oooh-oh, Angelina
    Oooh-oh, Angelina
    (Oooh-oh, Angelina)
    (Oooh-oh, Angelina)
