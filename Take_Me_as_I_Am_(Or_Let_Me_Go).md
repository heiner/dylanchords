    C                                  F
    Why must you always try to make me over
    G7                        C     G7
    Take me as I am or let me go
    C                  C7                F
    White lilies never grow on stalks of clover
    G7                        C    F   C    /c-b-a
    Take me as I am or let me go.

           G7                        C
    You're tryin' to reshape me in a mold love
           D7                           F     G
    In the image of someone you used to know
        C       /b   C7/Bb           F
    But I won't be a stand-in for an old love
    G7                        C     F      C
    Take me as I am or let me go.  [let me go]

    You tried to change me ever since you've met me
    Take me as I am or let me go
    If you can't overlook my faults, forget me
    Take me as I am or let me go.

    You're tryin' to reshape me in a mold love
    In the image of someone you used to know
    But I won't be a stand-in for an old love
    Take me as I am or let me go.
