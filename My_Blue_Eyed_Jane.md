Words and music Jimmie Rodgers  
Performed by Bob Dylan on *The Songs of Jimmie Rodgers – A Tribute*
(1997)  
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

The key may seem awkward, but he seems to have turned from “C- or
G-shape chords with capo” to “E- and A-shape barré chords” these days,
and so the key doesn't matter that much. What may still be an argument
for a capo on the 2nd fret, is that the second chord sounds more like a
D-shape chord than an E-shape, with the 3rd on the highest string. Just
to be sure, I've appended such a version at the end.

        B             E             B    F#        B
    The sweetest girl in the world is my blue eyed Jane
       F#                G#m          C#                 F#
    We fell in love like turtle doves while the moon was shining down
      B                 E                  B       F#          B
    I asked her then, I asked her when the wedding bells would ring
        C#                                                        F#
    She said, "Oh dear, it seems so queer, that this could happen here."

               B
    You are my little pal, and I've never known a sweeter gal
                 F#               B
    My blue eyed Jane, I love you so
                 B
    And when the sun goes down, and the shadows are creeping all over town
                        F#                 B
    Just meet me in the lane, my blue eyed Jane

    Janie dear, listen here, I've come to say farewell
    The world is drear without you dear, and now I cannot linger here
    I'm going away this very day, oh please come go with me
    I'll be sad and blue wantin' you, longin' all day through

    My little blue eyed Jane, you'll always be the same sweet thing
    I know you'll never change, I love you so
    And when the sun goes down, and the shadows are creeping over town
    Then I'll come back again, my blue eyed Jane.

    And when the sun goes down, and a shadows are creeping all over town
    Then I'll come back again, my blue eyed Jane.
