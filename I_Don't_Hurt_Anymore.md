<pre class="verse">
[n.c.]          C
I don't hurt anymore
                     G     C/g G
All my teardrops are dry.
                    D
No more walking the floor
                    G     C/g G7
With that burning inside.

[n.c.]                 C
Just to think it could be
                    G    C/g G
Time has opened the door
                 D
And at last I am free.
[n.c.]          G     C  G
I don't hurt anymore.

<pre class="bridge">
   C
No use to deny I wanted to die
                              G       C/g G
The day that you said we were through.
    A7
But now that I'm fine, you're out of my mind,
D7 [n.c.]
I can't believe that it's true.
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
I forgot it somehow
That I cared so before
And it's wonderful now.
I don't hurt anymore.
