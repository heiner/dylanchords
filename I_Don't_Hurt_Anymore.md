                                      I don't hurt . . .

    [n.c.]          C
    I don't hurt anymore
                         G     C/g G
    All my teardrops are dry.
                        D
    No more walking the floor
                        G     C/g G7
    With that burning inside.

    [n.c.]                 C
    Just to think it could be
                        G    C/g G
    Time has opened the door
                     D
    And at last I am free.
    [n.c.]          G     C  G
    I don't hurt anymore.

       C
    No use to deny I wanted to die
                                  G       C/g G
    The day that you said we were through.
        A7
    But now that I'm fine, you're out of my mind,
    D7 [n.c.]
    I can't believe that it's true.

    I forgot it somehow
    That I cared so before
    And it's wonderful now.
    I don't hurt anymore.
