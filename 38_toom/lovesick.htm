<pre class="verse">
    Em
I'm walking, 
         D               Em
through streets that are dead 
                 
Walking, 
D                      Em
walking with you in my head
               D
My feet are so tired 
   B           Am     Am7
My brain is so wired 
                   Em
And the clouds are weeping

Did I, 
hear someone tell a lie 
Did I, 
hear someone's distant cry
I spoke like a child 
You destroyed me with a smile 
while i was sleeping

G A                   G A
    I'm sick of love*)
                Em
That I'm in the thick of it 
G A                   G A
    This kind of love 
       Em 
I'm so sick of it

I see, 
I see lovers in the meadow 
I see, 
I see silhouettes in the window
I watch them 'til they're gone 
and they leave me hangin' on 
to a shadow

I'm sick of love 
I hear the clock tick 
this kind of love 
I'm lovesick

Sometimes 
the silence can be like thunder 
Sometimes 
I wanna take to the road of plunder
Could you ever be true? 
I think of you and I wonder

I'm sick of love 
I wish I'd never met you 
I'm sick of love 
I'm tryin' to forget you

Em                      D
Just don't know what to do
C                 B          Em 
I'd give anything to be with you

<p>*) <em>from a post to r.m.d. from Patricia Jungwirth</em>:
&ldquo;stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of
love&rdquo; &ndash; The Song of Solomon, 2:5 (in the absence of jh, I feel it's
my duty to point out that the phrase &ldquo;sick of love&rdquo; here means
&ldquo;sick with love&rdquo;. Of course, we all know that &ldquo;stay&rdquo; means
strengthen, &ldquo;flagons&rdquo; were cakes (not wine bottles &ndash; they didn't
have them!) and &ldquo;apples&rdquo; were probably oranges)</p>
