    F#

    Bm              A             E
    Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
    Bm              A          E
    Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
    Bm              D               E       F#
    Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle 'til the moon is blue,
    F# [n.c.]
    Wiggle 'til the moon sees you.

    Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
    Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
    Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, like a swarm of bees,
    Wiggle on your hands and knees.

    E                                  (F#)
    Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
    Bm
    Wiggle 'til you wiggle right out of here,
    E
    Wiggle 'til it opens, wiggle 'til it shuts,
    F#
    Wiggle 'til it bites, wiggle 'til it cuts.

    Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
    Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
    Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
    Wiggle - you can raise the dead.

    Wiggle 'til you're high, wiggle 'til you're higher,
    Wiggle 'til you vomit fire,
    Wiggle 'til it whispers, wiggle 'til it hums,
    Wiggle 'til it answers, wiggle 'til it comes.

    Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
    Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like pail of milk,
    Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
    Wiggle like a big fat snake.
