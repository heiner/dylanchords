              G
    There's a road that straight and narrow

    That the saints have travelled on

    filled with all the tribulations
           A7                D
    of the martyrs that have gone
              G
    If you're grateful for their victory

    and for showing us the way

    Give thanks for all your blessing,
        D                 G
    get on your knees and pray

          G             C                 G
    Thank God for every mountain and each sea
          G             A7              D
    Thank God for every flower and each tree
          G              C               G
    Thank God for giving life to you and me
        G                D     G
    Wherever you may be, thank God.

    There's a world of pain and sorrow
    filled with selfishness and greed.
    There remains that Glory Fountain
    To supply our every need
    You can find it in the temple
    With a welcome on the door
    But be sure to count your blessings
    Before you ask for more.

    Thank God for every flower and each tree
    Thank God for every mountain and the sea
    Thank God for giving life to you and me
    Wherever you may be, thank God.

“This is Bob Dylan. I'm in England right now, working, so I can't be
there tonight, but I'd like to say that Chabad is a worthy organization
helping people in need, helping to set them free from the misconceptions
and devastation which is destroying their lives from within.  
Of course this is a fierce battle, for those responsible for poisoning
the minds and bodies of America's youth are reaping great profits. If
you can help Chabad to help others who have fallen victims to the lies
and deceits of those who are much more powerful – do so.”

Last verse, not sung by Dylan:

    Be forgivin to the wayward
    Like the Master told us to
    When He said forgive them Father
    For they know not what they do
    They would change their way of livin'
    If they could but understand
    So remember they're your brothers
    They need a helpin' hand.
