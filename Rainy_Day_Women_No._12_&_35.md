I suggest a capo on the first fret for this one.

The B-riff is not used in the album version - just a straight B is
played.

<verse>

`             E`

Well, they'll stone ya when you're trying to be so good,

They'll stone ya just like they said they would.

`       A`

They'll stone ya when you're tryin' to go home.

`            E`

Then they'll stone ya when you're there all alone.

`     B`

But I would not feel so all alone, E Everybody must get stoned.

Well, they'll stone ya when you're walkin' 'long the street. They'll
stone ya when you're tryin' to keep your seat. They'll stone ya when
you're walkin' on the floor. They'll stone ya when you're walkin' to the
door. But I would not feel so all alone, Everybody must get stoned.

They'll stone ya when you're at the breakfast table. They'll stone ya
when you are young and able. They'll stone ya when you're tryin' to make
a buck. They'll stone ya and then they'll say, "good luck." Tell ya
what, I would not feel so all alone, Everybody must get stoned.

Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end. Then they'll stone
you and then they'll come back again. They'll stone you when you're
riding in your car. They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar.
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone, Everybody must get stoned.

Well, they'll stone you when you walk all alone. They'll stone you when
you are walking home. They'll stone you and then say you are brave.
They'll stone you when you are set down in your grave. But I would not
feel so all alone, Everybody must get stoned. </verse>

[Unplugged](/wiki/Unplugged "wikilink") version

</h2>
Played in E without a capo. The descending riffs are played with the
chord shapes xxx434, xxx323, xxx212, 022100, and correspondingly on the
other scale steps (see tab above).

The lyrics correspond more to what he sings these days. The three verses
seem to be there mostly as an excuse for long 12-bar blues jams.
Methinks he likes that...

<verse> They'll stone ya when you're trying to be so good, They'll stone
ya just like they said they would. Stone ya and they'll say that it's
the end. stone you, they'll be back again. I would not feel so all
alone, Everybody must get stoned.

Stone ya when you're at the breakfast table. Stone ya when you are young
and able. Stone ya and they'll say, "good luck." Stone ya just like you
got hit by a truck. I would not feel so all alone, Everybody must get
stoned.

They'll stone you and they'll be back for more Stone you and then
they'll close the door stone you and say that it's the end. stone you
and they'll be back again. I would not feel so all alone, Everybody must
get stoned. </verse>
