<pre class="verse">
    G     Em D C   G      C   G   
The first Noel the angels did sing
C      G       C    G   C     D  G      D       G  
Was to certain poor shepherds In fields as they lay
   G      Em    D    C     G       C     G    
In fields where they lay a-keeping their sheep
C    G       C     G  C  D    G D    G
On a cold winter's night that was so deep
</pre>

<pre class="refrain">
  G   Em D  G/b C D G
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Em   D  C   G C  D  G D G
Born is the king of Israel
</pre>

<pre class="verse chorus">
[They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east beyond them far
And to the Earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night]
</pre>

<pre class="refrain">
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the king of Israel
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the king of Israel   
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
And by the light of that same star
three wise men came from country far
to seek for a king was their intent
and to follow the star wherever it went.
</pre>

<pre class="refrain">
  G   Em D  G/b C /d /e /f# G    D/f#
Noel, Noel, Noel,     No -  el
Em   D  C   G C  D  G D G
Born is the king of Israel   

C   D  G
O   No-el
