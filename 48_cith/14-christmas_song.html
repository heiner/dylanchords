C                       G11
All through the year we waited
                          Cmaj7 Dm7 Em7
Waited through spring and fall
        C            Am/f#
To hear silver bells ringing
    B7         Em7
see wintertime bringing
    Am7      D9        G11
The happiest season of all:
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
Cmaj7     Dm7            Em7       Fmaj7 G7
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire, 
Cmaj7      Gm7     C7      Fmaj7   B7#9 E7
Jack Frost nipping at your nose, 
Am7      Dm7-5        Cmaj7     F#m7   B7
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir, 
    Emaj7                Fm7 Bb9 Ebmaj7   Dm7  
And folks dressed up like    Eskimos.

<pre class="verse">
G7        Cmaj7   Dm7             Em7       Fmaj7 Gsus4 G
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe,

 Help to make the season bright. 
Am7            Dm7-5         Cmaj7    F#m7   B7
Tiny little tots  with their eyes all aglow, 
     Em7     Am7     Dm7  G7   Cmaj7    (G6 Cmaj7)
Will find it hard to sleep   tonight.

               Gm7 C7             Gm7    C7     
They know that San -- ta's on his way; 
            Gm7          C7        Fmaj7
He's loaded lots of toys    on his sleigh. 
    Fm7            Bb7               Ebmaj7
And every mother's child is going to spy, 
          Am7             D7          Dm7   G7
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase, 
To kids from one to ninety-two, 
Although its been said many times, many ways, 
Merry Christmas to you
