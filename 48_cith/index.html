<div id="intro"><h2>Introductory Remarks </h2>
    <p>
    I love this album. It&rsquo;s a perfect follow-up, not to
    Dylan&rsquo;s trilogy of albums vacuum-cleaning the American song
    tradition for inspiration, but to his Theme Time Radio Hour.
    (And for the record, my negative evaluation of his latest studio albums
    does not stem from indignation over &lsquo;theft&rsquo;, should anyone
    have gotten that impression, but from a
    number of lacklustre performances of material of declining quality.)
</p>
<p>
It&rsquo;s hilarious. Finally, the &lsquo;wolfman&rsquo; voice has found a
home where it belongs: as a counterweight to the saccharine, a way to
scare the living soul out of the unsuspecting innocent, and perhaps
&ndash; just perhaps  &ndash; blow some meaning into these songs again.
</p>

<p> Because surely it&rsquo;s hilarious. But that&rsquo;s not the main
reason why I&rsquo;ve played this album more than any Dylan album since
<em>Time out of Mind</em>. The reason is simple: the way he sings
&lsquo;ad Bethlehem&rsquo; in <em>Adeste fideles</em> sends shivers down
my spine; his demonstration of Santa&rsquo;s laughter in <em>Must be
Santa</em> is the funniest thing since &lsquo;Talkin&rsquo; WWIII
Blues&rsquo;; the sombre tone of <em>Do you hear what I hear?</em> is
stunning and a perfect counterpart to the angelic serenity of <em>Hark!
The Herald Angels Sing</em>, perspectivizing both qualities and leaving
us, not somewhere undefined in the middle, but somewhere where there is
room for both sombre and serene, hilarious and breathtakingly beautiful.
</p>

<p> Of course, it&rsquo;s a brilliant idea of Dylan to make a Christmas
album, because it&rsquo;s the last thing anyone would have expected (and,
for that reason alone, perhaps not at all surprising). But <em>Christmas in the
Heart</em> is much more than a funny idea, a joke, or, for that matter,
just a nice way to do charity. It&rsquo;s obvious that he loves this
stuff.  And somehow, amid the croaking and the frolicking, he manages to
communicate that love, at least to <em>this</em> listener.  </p>

<p>
And when love is communicated, what more can one ask?
Have yourselves a merry Christmas!
