Said the night wind to the little lamb:
A                 Em   A 
Do you see what I see?
A                  Em     A     Em
Way up in the sky, little lamb,
A                 Em   A 
Do you see what I see?
  F#m    
A star, a star,
C#m
Dancing in the night,
       D       E        C#7    F#m
With a tail as big as a kite,
       D       E        A
With a tail as big as a kite.

Said the little lamb to the shepard boy:
Do you hear what I hear?
Ringing through the sky, shepard boy,
Do you hear what I hear?
A song, a song,
High above the trees,
With a voice as big as the sea,
With a voice as big as the sea.
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
Said the shepard boy to the mighty king:
Do you know what I know?
In your palace wall, mighty king,
Do you know what I know?
A child, a child,
Shivers in the cold.
Let us bring him silver and gold,
Let us bring him silver and gold.

</pre>
<pre class="verse">
Said the king to the people everywhere:
Listen to what I say.
Pray for peace people everywhere.
Listen to what I say.
The child, the child,
Sleeping in the night,
He will bring us goodness and light,
He will bring us goodness and light.
