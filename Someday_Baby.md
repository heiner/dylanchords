It sounds like the main lead guitar might play with a capo on the 6th
fret, but it might as well be played uncapoed; these are all standard
blues licks that any decent guitarist should be able to play anywhere on
the neck.

    Common lick between lines (relative to capo 6th fret):
      :     .     .     .       :            :     .     .     .       :

    |-------------------------|------      |--------------------------|-----
    |-------------------------|------      |--------------------------|-----

    Uncapoed:
      :     .     .     .       :            :     .     .     .       :

     I don't care what you do, I don't care what you say
                           Eb                 Bb
    I don't care where you go or how long you stay

    Someday baby, you ain't gon' worry po' me any more

    Well, you take my money and you turn me out
    You fill me up with nothin' but self doubt
    Someday baby, you ain't gon' worry po' me any more

    When I was young, driving was my crave
    You drive me so hard almost to the grave
    Someday baby, you ain't gon' worry po' me any more

    I'm so hard pressed, my mind tied up in knots
    I keep recycling the same old thoughts
    Someday baby, you ain't gon' worry po' me any more

    So many good things in life that I overlooked
    I don't know what to do now, baby, you got me so hooked
    Someday baby, you ain't gon' worry po' me any more

    Well, I don't want to brag, I wanna wring your neck
    When all else fails, I'll make it a matter of self respect
    Someday baby, you ain't gon' worry po' me any more

    You can take your clothes, put 'em in a sack
    You're goin' down the road, baby, and you can't come back
    Someday baby, you ain't gon' worry po' me any more

    I tried to be friendly, I tried to be kind
    I'm gonna drive you from your home just like I was driven from mine
    Someday baby, you ain't gon' worry po' me any more

    Living this way ain't a natural thing to do
    Why was I born to love you'
    Someday baby, you ain't gon' worry po' me any more

    Cadd9   G   D

    You take my money and you turn me out
    You fill me up with self doubt
    Someday baby, you ain't gon' worry po' me any more

    You made me eat a ton of dust
    You're potentially dangerous, and not worthy of trust
    Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry poor me any more

    [Instrumental verse]

    Little by little, bit by bit
    Every day I'm becoming more of a hypocrite
    Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry poor me any more

    You've got my mind tied up in knots
    I just keep recycling the same old thoughts
    Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry poor me any more

    When I heard you was cold, I bought you a coat and hat
    I think you must have forgotten about that
    Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry poor me any more

    [Instrumental verse]

    Gonna blow out your mind, and make you pure
    I've taken about as much of this as I can endure
    Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry poor me any more

    You put me down from the upper creek
    That's all right, to you I turn the other cheek
    Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry poor me any more

    [Instrumental verse]

    You say you need me, how would I know?
    You say you love me, but it can't be so
    Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry poor me any more

    I don't want to brag, but I'll wring your neck
    When all else fails, I'll make it a matter of self-respect
    Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry poor me any more

    [Instrumental verse]

    Living this way ain't a natural thing to do
    Why was I born to love you?
    Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry poor me any more
