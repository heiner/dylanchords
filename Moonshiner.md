Trad (aka The Bottle song, Moonshine blues or Kentucky Moonshiner), arr.
Bob Dylan  
Recorded August 12 1963 ([The Times They Are
A-changin'](/wiki/The Times They Are A-changin' "wikilink") sessions), and
released on [The Bootleg Series 1-3](/wiki/The Bootleg Series 1-3 "wikilink")
(1991)  
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

Capo 4th fret (sounding key C\# minor)  
Standard fingerpicking.

C/g (332010) is played in the turns around F. In the longer stretches
(such as from “moonshiner” to “years” in the first line), it changes to
a plain C chord, i.e. the bass goes from only picking the low G, to
alternating between C and G on the 5th and 6th strings.

Intro:

    Am . . . . . . C/g . . . . .
    F . . . C/g . . . . . . . . . . .

         Am     C/g F   C/g                       G7
    I've been a-a   moonshiner for seventeen long years
           Am      C/g F C/g                  G7
    I've spent all my-y  money on whiskey an' beer
      F          G          C/g       F
    I go to some hollow and set up my still
           Am   C/g F      C/g                            G7
    And if whiskey   don't kill me then I don't know what will.

    I'd go to some bar room and drink with my friends
    Where the women can't follow an' see what I've spent
    God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine
    Their breath is as sweet as the dew on the vine.

    Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry
    Hmm, dollars when I'm hard up, religion when I die
    The whole world's a bottle an' life's but a dram
    When a bottle gets empty, it sure ain't worth a damn.
