               C   G   C
    There is a city of gold
                  C                           F
    far from this rat-race with the bars that hold
                    C                     F
    far from the confusion, eat's at your soul
               C   G   F     C
    There is a city of gold.

    There is a country of light
    Raised up in glory, angels wearing white
    Never know sickness, never know night
    There is a country of light.

    There is a city of love
    Way from this world, stuff dreams are made of
    Fear of no darkness, stars high above
    There is a city of love.

    There is a city of hope
    There ain't no doctor, don't need no dope
    I'm ready and willing, throw down a rope
    There is a city of hope.

    There is a city of gold
    Far from this rat race And these bars that hold
    Rest for your spirit, peace for your soul
    There is a city of gold

               C   G   F   C/e Dm C
    There is a city of gold

          D7   G
    There is a city of love
    Surrounded by stars and the power above
    Far from this world and the stuff dreams are made of
    There is a city, city of love.

    There is a city of grace
    You drink holy water in a sanctified's place
    one's afraid to show their face
    There is a city, a city of grace

    [interlude]

    There is a city of peace
    Where all [foul form of] destruction will cease
    When the mighty have fallen and there's no police
    There is a city, a city of peace

    There is a city of hope
    Across the ravines by the green sunlit slope
    All I need is an axe and a rope
    To get to the city of hope.

    [interlude]

    I'm headed for the city of gold
    Before it's too late, before it gets too cold
    Before I'm too tired, before I'm too old
    I'm headed for the city of gold

    There is a city of gold (ad lib)
