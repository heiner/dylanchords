Well it's early in the evening and everything is still
Well it's early in the evening and everything is still
One more time, I'm walking up on heartbreak hill

Shake, shake mama, like a ship goin' out to sea

You took all my money and you give it to Richard Lee

Nothing shocks me more than that old clown

Some of you women you really know your stuff
Some of you women you really know your stuff
But your clothes are all torn and your language is a little too rough
</pre>

Shake, shake mama, shake it 'til the break of day
Shake, shake mama, shake it 'til the break of day
I'm right here baby, I'm not that far away

<pre class="verse">
I'm motherless, fatherless, almost friendless too
I'm motherless, fatherless, almost friendless too
It's Friday morning on Franklin Avenue

Shake, shake mama, raise your voice and pray
Shake, shake mama, raise your voice and pray
If you're goin' on home, better go the shortest way
