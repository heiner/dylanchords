    Come back here we can have some real fun

    Well it's early in the evening and everything is still
    Well it's early in the evening and everything is still
    One more time, I'm walking up on heartbreak hill

    Shake, shake mama, like a ship goin' out to sea
    Shake, shake mama, like a ship goin' out to sea
    You took all my money and you give it to Richard Lee

    Down by the river Judge Simpson walkin' around
    Down by the river Judge Simpson walkin' around
    Nothing shocks me more than that old clown

    Some of you women you really know your stuff
    Some of you women you really know your stuff
    But your clothes are all torn and your language is a little too rough

    Shake, shake mama, shake it 'til the break of day
    Shake, shake mama, shake it 'til the break of day
    I'm right here baby, I'm not that far away

    I'm motherless, fatherless, almost friendless too
    I'm motherless, fatherless, almost friendless too
    It's Friday morning on Franklin Avenue

    Shake, shake mama, raise your voice and pray
    Shake, shake mama, raise your voice and pray
    If you're goin' on home, better go the shortest way
