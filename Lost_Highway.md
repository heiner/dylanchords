             E           Esus4  E
I was just a lad, nearly twenty-two,
                                      B7
Neither good nor bad, just a kid like you,
            A                 E
And now I'm lost, too late to pray,
                  E         B7       E
I started rollin' down that lost highway.

Now, boys, don't start to ramble round,
On this road of sin or you're sorrow bound.
And you'll get lost, you'll curse the day
You started rollin' down that lost highway.

I'm a rolling stone, all alone and lost,
For a life of sin, I have paid the cost.
When I pass by, you'll curse the day
You started rollin' down that lost highway.
