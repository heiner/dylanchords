        Em
    I'm walking,
             D               Em
    through streets that are dead

    Walking,
    D                      Em
    walking with you in my head
                   D
    My feet are so tired
       B           Am     Am7
    My brain is so wired
                       Em
    And the clouds are weeping

    Did I,
    hear someone tell a lie
    Did I,
    hear someone's distant cry
    I spoke like a child
    You destroyed me with a smile
    while i was sleeping

    G A                   G A
        I'm sick of love*)
                    Em
    That I'm in the thick of it
    G A                   G A
        This kind of love
           Em
    I'm so sick of it

    I see,
    I see lovers in the meadow
    I see,
    I see silhouettes in the window
    I watch them 'til they're gone
    and they leave me hangin' on
    to a shadow

    I'm sick of love
    I hear the clock tick
    this kind of love
    I'm lovesick

    Sometimes
    the silence can be like thunder
    Sometimes
    I wanna take to the road of plunder
    Could you ever be true?
    I think of you and I wonder

    I'm sick of love
    I wish I'd never met you
    I'm sick of love
    I'm tryin' to forget you

    Em                      D
    Just don't know what to do
    C                 B          Em
    I'd give anything to be with you

\*) *from a post to r.m.d. from Patricia Jungwirth*: “stay me with
flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of love” – The Song of
Solomon, 2:5 (in the absence of jh, I feel it's my duty to point out
that the phrase “sick of love” here means “sick with love”. Of course,
we all know that “stay” means strengthen, “flagons” were cakes (not wine
bottles – they didn't have them!) and “apples” were probably oranges)
