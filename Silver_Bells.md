Tabbed by Eyolf Ã˜strem

Capo 1st fret (sounding key Ab major)

    D . . | D7 . . | C . . | G .

         G               G7/b
    City sidewalks, busy sidewalks
               C       Am
    Dressed in holiday style
           D             D7         G         C  D
    In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
             G                G7/b
    Children laughing, people passing
    B7      C           Am
    Meeting smile after smile
           D            D7            G
    And on every street corner you'll hear
        G             C
        Silver bells, silver bells
        D                          G
        It's Christmas time in the city
        G            C
        Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
        D                         G
        Soon it will be Christmas day

    Strings of streetlights, even stoplights
    Blink a bright red and green
    As the shoppers rush home with their treasures
    Hear the snow crunch, see the kids bunch
    This is Santa's big scene
    And above all this bustle you'll hear
        Silver bells, silver bells
        It's Christmas time in the city
        Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
        Soon it will be Christmas day
