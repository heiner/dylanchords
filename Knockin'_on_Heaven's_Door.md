Words and music Bob Dylan  
Released on [Pat Garrett &amp; Billy The
Kid](/wiki/Pat Garrett &amp; Billy The Kid "wikilink") (1973) and on
[Biograph](/wiki/Biograph "wikilink") (1985), and in live versions on [Before
the Flood](/wiki/Before the Flood "wikilink") (1974), [At
Budokan](/wiki/At Budokan "wikilink") (1978), ''Dylan and the Dead ''(1988),
[MTV Unplugged](/wiki/MTV Unplugged "wikilink") (1995), and [Live
1975](/wiki/Live 1975 "wikilink") (2002)  
Tabbed and transcribed by Eyolf Østrem

The challenge with this song is not the chords, which are quite simple,
actually, but the lyrics, which change quite a lot, almost from show to
show, with improvised new lines about what brings him to the door,
knockin'.

The Am7 is played as a simple Am in most versions.

[Unplugged](/wiki/Unplugged "wikilink") version same as below, but with a capo
on the 2nd fret (on Jackson's guitar; Dylan fumbles around with an
occasional lick on an uncapoed guitar).

In many live versions, the last line of the refrain is “Just like so
many times before” (thanks to Wayne Hampton for reminding me).

    |:G . D . Am7 . . . |G . D . C . . . :|

    G               D            Am7
    Mama, take this badge off of me
    G        D         C
     I can't use it anymore.
    G             D                 Am7
     It's gettin' dark, too dark to see
    G                D                    C
     I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door.

    Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
    Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
    Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
    Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door

    Mama, put my guns in the ground
    I can't shoot them anymore.
    That long black cloud is comin' down
    I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door.

    Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
    Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
    Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
    Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door

<h2 class="songversion">
Live 1975 version

</h2>
The chords are the same as above.

Mama wipe the blood off of my face  
I can't see through it anymore  
I need someone to talk to, and a new hiding place  
I feel like I'm looking at heaven's door

[Roger McGuinn:]  
Mama I can hear that thunder roar  
Echoin' down from God's distant shore  
I can hear 'em callin' for my soul  
Feel I'm knockin' on heaven's door

<h3>
Live version, 2001

The most stable chord sequence in the world (maybe with the exception of
"All Along the Watchtower") has been changed!

    E               B            F#m
    Mama, take this badge off of me
    E        B         A
     I can't use it anymore.
    A             E(/g#)            B
     It's gettin' dark, too dark to see
    C#m              B                    A
     I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door.

Alternative outtake verses from the Burbank sessions, Feb 1973

</h3>
Take \#1:

Mama, put my guns in the ground  
I don't need them anymore.  
long black train is comin' round  
I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door.

Mama, take this badge off of me  
I don't need it anymore.  
It's gettin' dark, too dark to see  
I feel I'm knockin' on heaven's door.

Mama, put my guns in the ground  
I can't shoot them anymore.  
that long black train is comin' round  
I'm knockin' up on heaven's door

Take \#2:

"Ok, let's do it without the vocal. It's the last time I work for
anybody though, on a movie. With music."

Various live lyric changes

They're bringin' me down and givin' me tears  
Feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door

Roger McGuinn's verse:  
Mama I can hear that thunder roar

Pull it down from shore to shore

Take the train by [...]

The sun is setting down  
On this ill-forgotten town  
Two riders are coming down  
Bury my heart in this ground
