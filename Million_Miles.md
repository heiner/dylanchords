Words and music by Bob Dylan<br>
Released on [[Time out of Mind]] (1997)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

Capo 4th fret (Original key Abm). The sevenths are generally
“instable”. Any bluesy addition to the basic chord goes (and
probably is somewhere in the soundscape of the recording...).

Em
You took a part of me that I really miss

I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this
    A7
You told yourself a lie
                                     Em
Thats alright mama I told myself one too
  B7                        A7                         Em
I try to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you

You took the silver, you took the gold
You left me standing out in the cold
People asked about you, I didn't tell them everything I knew
Well I try to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you

I'm driftin in and out of dreamless sleep
Somehow my memory's in a ditch so deep
Did so many things I never did intend to do
And I try to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you

I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low *)
I need every bit of it for the places that I go
Sometimes I wonder, tell us just what its all coming to
Well I try to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you

 ...

Well I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink
Maybe in the next life I'll be able to hear myself think
Feel like talking to somebody but I just don't know who
Well I try to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you

Yes the last thing you said before you hit the street
Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet
I said thats alright mamma you, you do what you gotta do
Well I try to get closer I'm still a million miles from you

Rock me pretty baby rock me all at once,
Rock me for a little while
Rock me for a couple of months And I'll rock you too
I try to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you

Well there's voices in the night trying to be heard
I'm sitting here listening to every mind-pollutin' word
I know plenty of people put me up for a day or two
Yes I try to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you

“I haven't seen this reference yet, but in “Million Miles”, the
line 'Turn your lamp down low' is from Blind Willie Mctell's great
Statesboro Blues. <br>
