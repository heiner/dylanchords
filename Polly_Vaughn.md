    [instr. verse]

    Em                     Am
     All ye brave huntsmen   who follow the gun
    Em                           B7
     Beware of a-shooting at the setting of the sun
            Em                              Am
    For her true love went a-huntin' and he   shot in the dark
        Em                B7             Em
    But oh and alas Polly Vaughn was his mark.

                G                                             B7
    She had her apron wrapped about her and he took her for a swan
    Em                   B7         Em
    Oh and alas - it was she, Polly Vaughn

    He ran up beside her when he found it was she
    His legs they grew weak and his eyes could not see
    He embraced her in his arms when he found she was dead
    And a fountain of tears for his true love he shed

    Oh, she had her apron wrapped about her and he took her for a swan
    Oh and alas - it was she, Polly Vaughn

    He took her in his arms and home ran he
    Crying: "Father, dear father, I've shot fair Polly
    I've shot that fair female in the bloom of her life
    And I always intended to make her my wife

    She had her apron wrapped about her and I took her for a swan
    Oh and alas - it was she, Polly Vaughn"

    Midnight, in his chamber, Polly Vaughn did appear
    Crying: "Jimmy oh Jimmy you have nothing to fear
    Stay in your country till your trial comes on
    you shall not be convicted for what you have done

    For I had my apron wrapped about me and you took me for a swan
    But oh and alas - it was I, Polly Vaughn"

    In the midst of his trial Polly Vaughn did appear
    Crying: "Uncle dear Uncle Jimmy Randall must be cleared"
    The judge and the lawyers stood around in a row
    Polly Vaughn in the middle like a fountain of snow

    She had her apron wrapped about her and he took her for a swan
    Oh and alas, it was she, Polly Vaughn
