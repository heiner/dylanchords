<h2 class="songversion"><em>Bootleg Series 1-3</em> version</h2>

<p>The phrase end lick is basically a succession of Gs and Bbs, with some
prominence to the Bb.</p>

<p>The G - C/g - G figure is somewhat more elaborate here than
elsewhere. The el-guitar playes a little figure that would have to be
played something like:</p>
<pre class="tab">
  G       C/g   G      
  |   .   .   .     |   .   .
|(3)--------------|----------
|-3---3---5-6-5-3-|-----3----
|-4---4---5-----4-|-----4---- etc
|-5---5---5-----5-|-----5----
|-----------------|----------
|-----------------|----------
</pre>
<p>or something to that effect.</p>
