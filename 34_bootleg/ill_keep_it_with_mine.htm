<h1 class="songtitle">I'll Keep It with Mine</h1>


<p>Words and music Bob Dylan<br />
Recorded Jan 14, 1965 and Jan 27, 1966, released on <a class="recordlink" href="../28_biograph/index.htm">Biograph</a> (1985) and <a class="recordlink" href="index.htm">The Bootleg Series 1-3</a> respectively<br />
Tabbed by Eyolf &Oslash;strem</p>

<p>Since these are both played at the piano, the value as a guitar tab is
limited, but what the heck...</p>

         C/e     F    C/g  F/a  C/g  
You will search, babe, 
 F C/e G/d F/a
At a - ny  cost. 
        C/e         F  C/g  F/a  
But how long, babe, 
C/g     F      C/e G/d    C   F/a
Can you search for what's not lost? 
C/e F C/g  F/a  C/g    F  C/e
Ev'ry-body will help you, 
     F          C/g  F/c
Some people are very kind. 
       C F C/e  Dm     C    F/a C/g G/d C    F/a
But if I           can save you a - ny  time, 
C     /b F/a     C/g F
Come on, give it to  me, 
C/e  Dm      F11  C
I'll keep it with mine. 

I can't help it 
If you might think I'm odd, 
If I say I'm loving you 
not for what you are But for what you're not. 
Everybody will help you 
Discover what you set out to find. 
But if I 
can save you any time, 
Come on, give it to me, 
I'll keep it with mine. 

Everybody will help you 
Discover what you set out to find. 
But if I 
can save you any time, 
Come on, give it to me, 
I'll keep it with mine. 

Now the train leaves 
At half past ten, 
But it'll be back, 
in the same old spot again. 
The conductor 
He's still stuck on the line. 
And if I 
can save you any time,
Come on, give it to me,
I'll keep it with mine.
