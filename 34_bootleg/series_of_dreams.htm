      C       G               C
I was thinking of a series of dreams
      C      G                C
Where nothing comes up to the top
     C    G                      C
Everything stays down where it's wounded
    C                    F
And comes to a permanent stop
       C
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
                                           F
Like in a dream, when someone wakes up and screams
C
Nothing too very scientific
             G               C
Just thinking of a series of dreams

Thinking of a series of dreams
Where the time and the tempo fly
And there's no exit in any direction
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes
Wasn't making any great connection
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme
Nothing that would pass inspection
Just thinking of a series of dreams
</pre>

<pre class="bridge">
Am          F                C
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
Am  F                 C
Into the path you are hurled
        Am       F                    C
And the cards are no good that you're holding
  C                         G     
Unless they're from another world
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
In one, numbers were burning
In another, I witnessed a crime
In one, I was running, and in another
All I seemed to be doing was climb
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
Not going to any great extremes
I'd already gone the distance
Just thinking of a series of dreams
