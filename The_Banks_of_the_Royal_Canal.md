Brendan Behan  
Recorded by Bob Dylan and The Band during [The Basement
Tapes](The Basement Tapes "wikilink") sessions (1967)  
Tabbed by Eyolf Ã˜strem

Em' = xx5450

The recording is much more jingle-jangly than this tab can convey. To
get that full effect, you'd need a full band of individualists who are
not quite certain about the tune. That's what Dylan had. If you're less
resourceful, you can approach that effect by inserting the D-A-G-D turn
(or hints of it) here and there where there's a long D.

    D

      D      G  D                  G   D
    A hungry feeling, came o'er me stealing
           G    A    D               Em'    G  A
    As the mice were squealing in my prison cell
             D   A  G  D        D  A   G  D
    And that old triangle, went jingle jangle
        G         D            A       D
    All along the banks of the Royal Canal.

    To begin the morning, with the water boiling
    Get out of bed, clean up your cell
    And the old triangle, went jingle jangle
    All along the banks of the Royal Canal.

    On a fine spring evening the lag lay dreamin'
    The sea-gulls beamin' high above the wall
    And that old triangle, goes jingle jangle
    All along the banks of the Royal Canal.

    The screw was peepin' and the lag lay sleapin'
    As he lay there weeping for his good gal Sal.
    And the old triangle, went jingle jangle
    All along the banks of the Royal Canal.

    In the female prison there are seventy women
    and it's with all of them where I'd like to dwell
    And the old triangle, would go jingle jangle
    All along the banks of the Royal Canal.

    Ah, the day was dying and the lag was sighing
    As I lay cryin' in my prison cell
    And that old triangle, went jingle jangle
    All along the banks of the Royal Canal.
