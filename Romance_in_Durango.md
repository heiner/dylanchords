    D

    D                                   A
    Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun
                           G   D
    Dust on my face and my cape,
                            A
    Me and Magdalena on the run
                                  G   D
    I think this time we shall escape.

    Sold my guitar to the baker's son
    For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
    But I can get another one
    And I'll play for Magdalena as we ride.

    A
    No llores, mi querida

    Dios nos vigila
                                     G  D
    Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
      A
    Agarrame, mi vida

    Soon the desert will be gone
                                    G  D
    Soon you will be dancing the fandango.

    Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people
    Hoofbeats like castanets on stone.
    At night I dream of bells in the village steeple
    Then I see the bloody face of Ramon.

    Was it me that shot him down in the cantina
    Was it my hand that held the gun?
    Come, let us fly, my Magdalena
    The dogs are barking and what's done is done.

    No llores, mi querida
    Dios nos vigila
    Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
    Agarrame, mi vida
    Soon the desert will be gone
    Soon you will be dancing the fandango.

    At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
    And watch the young torero stand alone.
    We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
    When they rode with Villa into Torre6n.

    Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
    In the little church this side of town.
    I will wear new boots and an earring of gold
    You'll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown.

    The way is long but the end is near
    Already the fiesta has begun.
    The face of God will appear
    With His serpent eyes of obsidian.

    No ilores, mi querida
    Dios nos vigila
    Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
    Agarrame, mi vida
    Soon the desert will be gone
    Soon you will be dancing the fandango.

    Was that the thunder that I heard?
    My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain.
    Come sit by me, don't say a word
    Oh, can it be that I am slain?

    Quick, Magdalena, take my gun
    Look up in the hills, that flash of light.
    Aim well my little one
    We may not make it through the night.

    No llores, mi querida
    Dios nos vigila
    Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
    Agarrame, mi vida
    Soon the desert will be gone
    Soon you will be dancing the fandango.
