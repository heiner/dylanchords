    I've just reached a place
    Am
    Where the willow don't bend.
            Dm
    There's not much more to be said
    /c       Bb
    It's the top of the end.
        F
    I'm going,
        C
    I'm going,
        Dm
    I'm gone.

    I'm closin' the book
    On the pages and the text
    And I don't really care
    What happens next.
    I'm just going,
    I'm going,
    I'm gone.

    I been hangin' on threads,
    I been playin' it straight,
    Now, I've just got to cut loose
    Before it gets late.
    So I'm going,
    I'm going,
    I'm gone.

    Am                                     G
    Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
    G                         C/g        G
    And you'll be fine at the end of the line.
    G                     C/g      G
    All that's gold isn't meant to shine.
          Am                    C         D       /(c c bb bb a)
    Don't you and your one true love ever part."

    I been walkin' the road,
    I been livin' on the edge,
    Now, I've just got to go
    Before I get to the ledge.
    So I'm going,
    I'm just going,
    I'm gone.

    I've just reached a place
    Where the willow don't bend.
    There's no more to be said
    It's the top of the end.
    I'm going,
    I'm going,
    I'm gone.

    I've been right on the edge
    playing it cool
    Now I just got to go
    Before I break the rules (?)

    I've been leaning on you
    for just too long
    and it's not (good?) for you
    it's not making me strong, so...

    Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
    And you'll be fine at the end of the line.
    All that's gold isn't meant to shine.
    Don't you and your one dream ever part."

    I'm in love with you baby
    but you got to understand
    that you got to be free
    so let go of my hand

    I've just reached a place
    Where the willow don't bend.
    There's not much more to be said
    It's the top of the end.
    I'm going,
    I'm going,
    I'm gone.

    I'm in love with you baby
    but you got to understand
    that you want to be free,
    so let go of my hand

    I've been sleeping on the road
    with my head in the dust
    Now I just got to go
    before it's all diamonds and rust

    Papa said: Son go and follow you heart
    You'll be fine at the end of the line
    All that's gold wasn't meant to shine
    Don't you and your life-long dream ever part

    I've just reached a place
    before I can hardly see
    And I'll just be too long
    so (...) take it what you see

    Papa said...

    I've been telling you baby
    and you got to understand
    that you want to be free
    so let go of my hand

    Come over here baby
    'cause I'm telling you this
    You gotta believe it
    you gotta give me one more kiss

    Fix me one more drink baby
    and hold me one more time
    But don't get too close
    To make me change my mind

           Am                                                     G
    Now my mama always said something true: you gotta follow your heart
    G                     C          G
    You'll be fine at the end of the line

    Just don't put your horse in front of the car

    [instr. verse]

    Now from Boston to Birmingham
    is a two day ride
    But I got to be going now
    'cause I'm so dissatisfied

    Am     G

    I've just reached a place
    where I'm feeling kind of low
    I don't mind leaving
    And you know I'm not afraid to go

    Fix me one more drink baby
    and hold me one more time
    But don't get too close
    and try and make me change my mind

    I've been hanging round your house so long
    You been treating me like a clown
    You don't know how to do nothing,
    'cept tear a good man's reputation down

    You know my mama always said: "Son be true and follow your heart
    You'll be fine at the end of the line
    All that's gold wasn't meant to shine
    just don't put your horse in front of your car

    Come over here one more time, baby,
    you might shake my hand
    I could find me another woman
    and you could find you another man

    Come over here quickly one time baby
    and shake my had
    I could find me another woman
    you could find you another man
