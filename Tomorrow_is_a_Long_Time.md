    If today was not an endless highway, *)

    Then lonesome would mean nothing to you at all.

             C/g        D/f#              C/g  G
    Yes, and only if my own true love was waitin',
       C/g              D/f#           C/g     G
    if I could hear her heart a-softly poundin',

        C/g . . .     D7/f# . . .     C/g  G | C/g  G | C/g   G | G
    I'd lie     in my bed       once again.

    I can't see my reflection in the waters,
    I can't speak the sounds that show no pain,
    I can't hear the echo of my footsteps,
    Or can't remember the sound of my own name.

    Yes, and only if my own true love was waitin',
    Yes, and if I could hear her heart a-softly poundin',
    Only if she was lyin' by me,
    Then I'd lie in my bed once again.

    There's beauty in the silver, singin' river,
    There's beauty in the sunrise in the sky,
    But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
    That I remember in my true love's eyes.

    Yes, and only if my own true love was waitin',
    Yes, and if I could hear her heart a-softly poundin',
    Only if she was lyin' by me,
    Then I'd lie in my bed once again.

all quite simple actually – don't let the appearance scare you.
