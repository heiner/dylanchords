By Bob Dylan and Jacques Levy  
Released on [Desire](/wiki/Desire "wikilink") (1976)  
Tabbed by Eyolf Ã˜strem

Note that the descending riff that goes through the song closely
resembles the characteristic passage in [Abandoned
Love](/wiki/Abandoned Love "wikilink"), written at about the same time.

    G/d        D'         G    D
     I like to spend some time in Mozambique
    G/d        D'     G  D
     The sunny sky is aqua blue
    G/d          D'      G  D
     And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek.
    C          G       D
     It's very nice to stay a week or two,
    C          G       D
     And maybe fall in love just me and you.

    There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
    And plenty time for good romance
    And everybody likes to stop and speak
    To give the special one you seek a chance
    Or maybe say hello with just a glance.

    Bm                       F#m
    Lying next to her by the ocean
    Em                            D
    Reaching out and touching her hand,
    Bm                      F#m
    Whispering your secret emotion
    G                  A
    Magic in a magical land.

    And when it's time for leaving Mozambique
    To say goodbye to sand and sea,
    You turn around to take a final peek
    And you see why it's so unique to be
    Among the lovely people living free
    Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique.
