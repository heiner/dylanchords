G       Am7      G    Am7  G        Am7     G     Am7
Get you a copper kettle,   get you a copper coil,
G      Am7            G      Am7    C          /b     Am
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil.

<pre class="refrain">
            C                G
You'll just lay there by the juniper 
C                 G
while the moon is bright,
C          /b     Am
Watch them jugs a-filling 
       C(maj7)     G
In the pale    moonlight. 
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
G           Am7       G   Am7  G        Am7     G     Am7
Build you a fire with hickory, hickory, ash and oak,
G            Am7      G         Am7        C          
Don't use no green or rotten wood; they'll get you by the smoke.
</pre>

My daddy, he made whiskey; my granddaddy, he did too.

 We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792.
