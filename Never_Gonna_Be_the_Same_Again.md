A
Now you're here beside me, baby,
D/a             E
You're a living dream.
    A
And every time you get this close
   D/a              E
It makes me want to scream.
    F6
You touched me and you knew
           A                D
That I was warm for you and then,
                    E            A
I ain't never gonna be the same again.

Sorry if I hurt you, baby,
Sorry if I did.
Sorry if I touched the place
Where your secrets are hid.
But you meant more than everything,
And I could not pretend,
I ain't never gonna be the same again.

You give me something to think about, baby,
Bm           A
Every time I see ya.
G#                   C#m
Don't worry, baby, I don't mind leaving,
    Bm                 E
I'd just like it to be my idea.

<pre class="verse">
You taught me how to love you, baby,
You taught me, oh, so well.
Now, I can't go back to what was, baby,
I can't unring the bell.
You took my reality
And cast it to the wind
And I ain't never gonna be the same again.
