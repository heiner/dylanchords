'Driftin' too far from shore' “)

Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

    Ab9                           Bb
    I didn't know that you'd be a-leavin'
    Ab9                                 Bb
    Who you thought you were talkin' to
    Ab9                          Bb
     I figure you maybe we're even
    Ab9                       Bb
    Or maybe I'm one up on you.

    Eb                   Bb
     I sent you all my money
    Eb                 Bb
     Just like I did before
    Eb                  Ab
     I try to reach you honey
                                     Bb
    But you're driftin' too far from shore.

    Driftin' too far from shore
    Driftin' too far from shore
    Driftin' too far from shore
    Driftin' too far from shore.

    I ain't gonna get lost in this current
    I don't like playin' cat an' mouse
    No gentleman likes makin' love to a servant
    Especially when he's in his father's house.
    I never could guess your weight baby
    Never needed to call you my whore
    I always thought you were straight baby
    But you're driftin' too far from shore.

    Well driftin' too far from shore
    Driftin' too far from shore
    Driftin' too far from shore
    Driftin' too far from shore.

    Well these times an' these tunnels are haunted
    The bottom of the barrel is too
    I waited years sometimes, for what I wanted
    Everybody can't be as lucky as you.
    Never no more do I wonder
    Why you don't never play with me any more
    An' any moment you can go under
    Cause you're driftin' too far from shore.

    Yeah driftin' too far from shore
    Driftin' too far from shore
    Driftin' too far from shore
    Driftin' too far from shore.

    You an' me we had completeness
    I'd give you all of what I could provide
    We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
    We were the wrong side.
    I've already ripped out the phones, honey
    You can't walk the streets in a war
    I can finish this alone honey
    You're driftin' too far from shore.
