                 C                 F             C
    The sweetest songs are sung by lovers in the moonlight,
                 G                              C
    The sweetest days are the days that used to be.
                C            F                   C
    The saddest words I ever heard were words of parting
                   G                    C
    When you said "Sweetheart, remember me."

             F                             C
    Remember me when the candle lights are gleamin',
             G                               C
    Remember me at the close of a long, long day.
               F                           C
    Just be so sweet when all alone you're dreamin'
                     G              C
    Just to know you still remember me.

    A brighter face may take my place when we're apart, dear,
    A brighter smile an' a love more bold and free.
    But in the end, fair weather friends may break your heart, dear.
    An' if they do, sweetheart, remember me.

    Remember me when the candle lights are gleamin',
    Remember me at the close of a long, long day.
    Just to be so sweet when all alone you're dreamin'
    Just to know you still remember me.

    You told me once you were mine alone forever,
    You were mine till the end of eternity.
    But now it's over, dear, and we can never
    Be the same except in memory.

    Remember me when the candle lights are gleamin',
    Remember me at the close of a long, long day.
    Just be so sweet when all alone you're dreamin'
    Just to know you still remember me.
