    On the banks of the river       where the willows hang down
                           Em                        G      C/g G
    And the wild birds all warble with a low moaning sound
                Em                          G        C/g G
    Down in the hollow where the water runs cold
                         C                    /b   /a  G     C/g G
    It was there I first listened to the lies that you told

    Now I lie on my bed and I see your sweet face
    The past I remember time cannot erase
    The letter you wrote me it was written in shame
    And I know that your conscience still echoe's my name

    Now the nights are so long, ah, sorrow runs deep
    Nothing is worse than a night without sleep
    I'll walk out alone and look at the sky
    Too empty to sing, too lonesome to cry

    Now, if the ladies were blackbirds and the ladies wore thrushes
    I'd lie there for hours in the chilly cold marshes
    If the ladies were squirrel's with them high bushy tails
    I'd fill up my shotgun with rock salt and nails
