Words and music Bob Dylan  
Recorded during the Basement Sessions (1967)  
Tabbed by Eyolf Ã˜strem

It actually sounds as if Dylan has left his beloved G-C/g-G chord
structure here, and instead plays in A, with a capo on the 1st fret.

    Silent weekend,

    My baby she gave it to me

    Silent weekend,
       A
    My baby she gave it to me.
          E7
    She's opened every heart
           D7
    but at sleep [...] and be part (??)
              A
    and she's leavin' me down in misery.

    Silent weekend,
    My baby she took me by the heart.
    Silent weekend,
    My baby she took me by the heart.
    She's [awake and] bad, she's boastin'
    but I know I know she's ghostin'
    An' she's tearin' me all apart.

    Silent weekend,
    Oh Lord, I wish Monday would come.
    Silent weekend,
    Oh Lord, I sure wish Monday would come.
    She's [open] and she's leavin',
    but I hate to sit here grievin'
    but I just can't sit here playin' dumb.

                   D
    Well, I done a whole lotta thinkin' 'bout a whole lot of cheatin',
          A
    And I, maybe I did please.
               B7
    But I just walloped a lotta pizza after makin' our peace,
            Esus4            E
    Puts ya down on bended knees.

    Silent weekend,
    Man alive, I'm burnin' up on my brain.
    Silent weekend,
    Man alive, I'm burnin' up on my brain.
    She knows when I'm just teasin'
    But it's not likely in the season
    To open up a passenger train.
