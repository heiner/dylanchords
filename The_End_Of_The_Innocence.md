Written by Bruce Hornsby and Don Henley  
Performed regularly by Bob Dylan during the fall 2002 tour  
Tabbed by Eyolf Ã˜strem

The intro is playable in G, but the two highest strings that seem to be
sounding throughout made me think they might be open strings, hence capo
3rd fret and key of E. I don't think that's what they're playing, but it
sounds better that way, so I added a tab like that (see below).  
I should also say that my copy of this song isn't the best-sounding
ever, so there are probably mistakes.

    G
     Remember when the days were long
        C
    and rolled beneath a deep blue sky
    G
     Didn't have a care in the world
    C                              D    Dsus4 D
     With mommy and daddy standing by
    G
     But happily ever after fails
    C
     and we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
    G
     The lawyers dwell on small details
    Em          C      D
    Since daddy had to fly

    Em              Bm          Am      C
    Ah but I know a place where we can go
    Em  C         D
     untouched by man
    Em         Bm                Am   C
     watch the clouds go rollin' by
    Em                    C                D
     watch the tall grass waving in the wind
    G           D C
    lay your head  down on the ground
    Em         Bm            Am            C
     let your hair fall all around me
    G      D       C
    Offer up  your best defense
    Em          Bm    Am
    this is the end,
    C              D
    This is the end
           G
    Of the Innocence

    Oh beautiful for spacious skies
    But now those skies are threatening
    They're beating plowshares into swords
    For this tired old man that we elected king
    Armchair warriors often fail
    And we've been poisoned by these fairytales
    The lawyers clean up all details
    Since daddy had to lie

    But I know a place where we can go
    And wash away the sin
    We'll sit and watch the clouds go by
    And the tall grass wave in the wind
    You can lay your head back on the ground
    Let your hair fall all around me
    Offer up your best defense
    But this is the end, This is the end
    Of the Innocence

    Who knows how long this will last
    Or how we've come so far so fast
    But somewhere back there in the dust
    That same small town in each of us
    I need to remember this
    Darling, give me one more kiss
    And let me take a long last look
    Before we say goodbye

    Just lay your head back on the ground
    And let your hair fall all around me
    Offer up your best defense
    But this is the end
    This is the end
    of the Innocence
