        C                           F                  C
    Was on the Blue Ridge Mountain, there I'll take my stand
                                    F                  C
    Was on the Blue Ridge Mountain, there I'll take my stand
    F                         C
    Rifle on my shoulder, six-shooter in my hand
                     C         G          C
    Lord, Lord, I've been all around this world.

    Hattie, oh Hattie, come out and by the door
    Hattie, oh Hattie, come out, come out and by the door
    'Fore I have to step in with my .44.
    God knows, I been all around this world

    Hang me, oh hang me, I'll be dead and gone
    Hang me, oh hang me, I'll be dead and gone
    wouldn't mind your hanging boy, but your jailing takes too long  [/wait in jail so long]
    Lord, Lord, I've been all around this world

    Was on the Blue Ridge Mountain, there I'll take my stand
    Was on the Blue Ridge Mountain, there I'll take my stand
    Rifle on my shoulder, six-shooter in my hand
    Lord, Lord, I've been all around this world
