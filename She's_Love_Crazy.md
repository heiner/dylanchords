    No doubt about it, that woman's posessed

    Big blue eyes and a skin tight dress,
                   Bm
    You know she's love crazy
    F#m
    Love crazy
               C#7
    Ah, may be love crazy,
                                    F#m
    but I wouldn't have it no other way. *)

    Well, I met that woman 1961
     Told me to do things I never could have done**)
    You know she's love crazy
    Well, she's love crazy
    You know, she's love crazy,
    but I wouldn't have it no other way.

    Well, she needed lovin' and she needs it bad
    If she don't get it, well it makes her mad
    she's love crazy
    Ah, may be love crazy
    Well, she's love crazy,
    but I wouldn't want it no other way.

    Well, she needs it badly like she needs her food
    If she don't get it, well, it just makes her rude
    she's love crazy
    Well, she's love crazy
    She's love crazy,
    but I wouldn't have it no other way.

    Well, she's love crazy
    Well, maybe love crazy
    Well, she's love crazy
    Well, she's love crazy
    Well, she's love crazy
    but I wouldn't want it no other way.
