Trad.  
Played by Bob Dylan and band in *Masked and Anonymous* (2003)  
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

* * * * *

Someone, probably Dylan, plays the F (or something like it) in the
refrain straight through the following D, and embellishes the following
G with a C/g-G figure. The second time, the F is played right through
the G as well. Economy of means, I think it's called...  
The Csus4 in the last line of the refrain could just as well be played
as an F (or for that matter, as a G – works just as well).

      C
    I wish I was in the land of cotton
    F
    Old times there are not forgotten
          C
    Look away, look away
          G         C
    Look away, Dixieland

    In Dixieland where I was born,
    Early on one frosty morning
    Look away, Look away,
    Look away, Dixieland

      C             F       D     G
    I wish I was in Dixie, away, away
       C              F
    In Dixieland I'll take my stand
       C               G
    to live and die in Dixie,
     C     G     C        Csus4    C
    Away, away, away down south in Dixie
     C     G     C        Csus4    C
    Away, away, away down south in Dixie

    [instr. verse]

    In Dixieland where I was born,
    Early on one frosty morn
    Look away, Look away,
    Look away, Dixieland

    I wish I was in Dixie, away, away
    In Dixieland I'll take my stand
    to live and die in Dixie,
    Away, away, away down south in Dixie
    Away, away, away down south in Dixie
