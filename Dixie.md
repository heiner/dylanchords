Trad.<br>
Played by Bob Dylan and band in ''Masked and Anonymous'' (2003)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

----
Someone, probably Dylan, plays the F (or something like it) in the
refrain straight through the following D, and embellishes the
following G with a C/g-G figure. The second time, the F is played
right through the G as well. Economy of means, I think it's
called...<br>
The Csus4 in the last line of the refrain could just as well be played
as an F (or for that matter, as a G – works just as well).

I wish I was in the land of cotton
F
Old times there are not forgotten
      C
Look away, look away
      G         C
Look away, Dixieland

In Dixieland where I was born,
Early on one frosty morning
Look away, Look away,
Look away, Dixieland

  C             F       D     G
I wish I was in Dixie, away, away
   C              F
In Dixieland I'll take my stand
   C               G
to live and die in Dixie,
 C     G     C        Csus4    C
Away, away, away down south in Dixie

Away, away, away down south in Dixie
