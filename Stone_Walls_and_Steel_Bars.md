<pre class="verse">
G                          C          G
Stone walls, steel bars, a love on my mind.
      G                     C              G
I'm a three time loser, I'm long gone this time.

D            C             G
Jealousy has took my young life,
D                     C           G
all for the love of another man's wife.
    G                        G7            C
But I've had it comin', I've known all the time.
        G                          D         G
No more stone walls, steel bars or you on my mind.

Stone walls, steel bars, a love on my mind.
I'm a three time loser, I'm long gone this time.

Old, gray warden, dark Frisco Bay.
Guards all around me, leadin' my way.
I've had it comin, I tend o'er the line.
No more stone walls, steel bars nor you on my mind.

Stone walls, steel bars, a love on my mind.
I'm a three time loser, I'm long gone this time.
I'm a three time loser, I'm long gone this time.
