Written by Joseph S. Newman, popularized by Lord Buckley (see their
versions below)<br>
Dylan's version has the story from these, but the delivery is his
own.<br>
Recorded on the third Gaslight Tape<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

The verses that Dylan divides this into, are marked by two figures:
first a short turn from G to C and back again, then a shift to D,
where he stays for a shorter or longer time, “talkin' blues”
fashion.

The turns from G to C are played:

<pre class="verse">
| G . . C | G . . etc
</pre>

The shift from G to D is played like this:

<pre class="tab">
  G                 D
  :   .   .   .     :   .
|---3---3---3-----|---2---

This is the story of Hezekiah Jones...

Hezekiah Jones lived in a place... in Arkansas.
             G       C G
He never had too much,
                        G-D
except he had some land,

An' he had a couple of hogs and things like that.

G
He never had much money
       C       G
But he spent what he did make as fast as he made it,
                                   G-D
So it never really mattered that he had much money.

                        G  C G
But in a cupboard there,
                          G-D
He kept in the cupboard...

he kept in the cupboard books,
                                        G    C G
He called the books his "rainy season."

                                                          C G
The white folks around the county there talked about Hezekiah...
     G-D
They... said, "Well... old Hezekiah, he's harmless enough,

but the way I see it he better put down them goddam books,
                                                   G     C G
Readin' ain't no good, for an ignorant nigger."

G-D

One day the white man's preacher came around
                                       G
Knockin' on doors, knockin' on all the doors in the county,
                  C      G
He knocked on Hezekiah's door.

He says, "Hezekiah, you believe in the Lord?"
   /c          /b                    D
Hezekiah says, "Well, I don't know, I never really SEEN the Lord,

I can't say, yes, I do..."

              G
He says, "Hezekiah, you believe in the Church?"
              C           G
Hezekiah says, "Well, the Church is divided, ain't they,
      C           G
And... they can't make up their minds.
                      D
I'm just like them, I can't make up mine either."

              G
He says, "Hezekiah, you believe
                 C    G                D-G
that if a man is good Heaven is his last reward?"
                        G-D
Hezekiah says, "I'm good... good as my neighbor."

                      G                                 C-G
"You don't believe in nothin'," said the white man's preacher,
                         C /b D
You don't believe in nothin'!"

"Oh yes, I do," says Hezekiah,

"I believe that a man should be indebted to his neighbor

Not for the reward of Heaven or fear of hellfire."

                    G
"But you don't understand," said the white man's preacher,
                  C                         G           G-D
"There's a lot of good ways for a man to be wicked..."

                                             /e-f# G
Then they hung Hezekiah high as a pigeon.
                                        C   /b-a  G      D
White folks around there said, "Well... he had it comin'

'Cause the son-of-a-bitch never had no religion!"

<h2>Black Cross</h2>
Joseph S. Newman

Hezekiah Jones of Hogback County <br>
Lived on a hill in a weather-beaten hovel <br>
And all that he owned was a two-acre plot <br>
And a bed and some books and a hoe and a shovel.

Hezekiah, black as the soil he was hoeing, <br>
Worked pretty hard to make ends meet; <br>
Raised what he ate, with a few cents over <br>
To buy corn likker that he drank down neat,

And a few cents more that he put in the cupboard <br>
Against what he called “de rainy season,” <br>
But he never got to save more'n two or three dollars <br>
Till he gave it away for this or that reason.

The white folks around knew old Hezekiah... <br>
“Harmless enough, but the way I figger <br>
He better lay off'n them goddam books, <br>
'Cause readin' ain't good fer an ignorant nigger.”

Reverend Green, of the white man's church, <br>
Finally got around to “comin' ovah <br>
To talk with you-all about the Pearly Kingdom <br>
An' to save yo' soul fer the Lawd Jehovah!”

“D'ya b'lieve in the Lawd?” asked the white man's preacher. <br>
Hezekiah puckered his frosty brow, <br>
“Well I can't say 'yes,' so I ain't gonna say it, <br>
Caze I ain't SEEN de Lawd....nowhere....no-how.”

“D'ya b'lieve in Heaven?” asked the white man's preacher, <br>
“Where you go, if you're good, fer yer last rewa'hd?” <br>
“Ah'm good,” said Hezikiah, “good as Ah'm able, <br>
But Ah don't expect nothin' from Heaven OR the Lawd.”

“D'ya b'lieve in the Church?” asked the white man's preacher. <br>
Hezekiah said, “Well de Church is divided; <br>
Ef they can't agree, than Ah cain't neither... <br>
Ah'm like them....Ah ain't decided.”

“You don't b'lieve nothin',” roared the white man's preacher. <br>
“Oh yes Ah does,” said old Hezikiah, <br>
“Ah b'lieve that a man's beholden to his heighbash <br>
Widout de hope of Heaven or de fear o' hell's fiah.”

There's a lot of good ways for a man to be wicked... <br>
They hung Hezikiah as high as a pidgeon, <br>
And the nice folks around said, “He had it comin' <br>
'Cause the son-of-a-bitch didn't have no religion!”

<h2 class="songversion">Lord Buckley's version</h2>

It's a beautiful thing.

It was written by Paul Newman's beloved grandfather, in Cleveland, <br>
a Cleveland poet. It's “Black Cross.”

There was Old Hezekiah Jones, of Hogback County. <br>
He lived on a hill in a weatherbeaten hovel. <br>
And all that he owned was a two-acre plot <br>
with a bed and some books and a hoe and a shovel.

Old Hezekiah, black as the soil he was hoeing, <br>
Worked pretty hard to make both ends meet. <br>
Raised what he ate, with a few cents over <br>
To buy corn likker that he drank down neat,

And a few cents more that he put in the cupboard <br>
Against what he called “de rainy season,” <br>
But he never got to save more'n two or three dollars <br>
Till he gave it away for this or that reason.

The white folks around knew old Hezekiah... <br>
“Harmless enough, but the way I figger <br>
He better lay off'n them goddam books, <br>
'Cause readin' ain't good fer an ignorant nigger.”

Reverend Green, of the white man's church, <br>
Finally got around to “comin' ovah <br>

An' to save yo' soul fer the Lawd Jehovah!”

“D'ya b'lieve in the Lawd?” asked the white man's preacher. <br>
Hezekiah puckered his frosty brow, <br>
“Well I can't say 'yes,' so I ain't gonna say it, <br>
Caze I ain't SEEN de Lawd....nowhere....no-how.”

“D'ya b'lieve in Heaven?” asked the whiteman's preacher, <br>
“Where you go, if you're good, fer yer last rewa'hd?” <br>
“Ah'm good,” said Hezikiah, “good as Ah'm able, <br>
But Ah don't expect nothin' from Heaven OR the Lawd.”

“D'ya b'lieve in the Church?” asked the white man's preacher. <br>

Ah'm like them....Ah ain't decided.”

“You don't b'lieve nothin',” roared the white man's preacher. <br>
“Oh yes Ah does,” said old Hezikiah, <br>
“Ah b'lieve that a man's beholden to his neighbahs <br>
Widout de hope of Heaven or de fear o' hell's fiah.”

There's a lot of good ways for a man to be wicked... <br>
They hung Hezikiah as high as a pidgeon, <br>
And the nice folks around said, “He had it comin' <br>
'Cause the son-of-a-bitch didn't have no religion!”
