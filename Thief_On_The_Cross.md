Written by Bob Dylan  
Dylan's last gospel song, performed once, in New Orleans, Nov 10, 1981  
Tabbed by Eyolf Ã˜strem

The riff that runs through the song is basically the same as in Cover
Down Break Through, and several other gospel period songs. It can be
played something like:

      A                 D     C
      :   .   .   .     :   .   .   .
    |-0---------------|-2-----0---------|
    |-2---------------|-3-----1---------|
    |-2---------------|-2-----0---------|
    |-2---------------|-0-----2---------|
    |-0---------------|-------3---------|
    |-----------------|-----------------|

The C can be replaced by a D11 (xx0010 or x55555), and the order of the
chords is frequently reversed:

      A                 C     D     C
      :   .   .   .     :   .   .   .
    |-0---------------|-0-----2-----0---|
    |-2---------------|-1-----3-----1---|
    |-2---------------|-0-----2-----0---|
    |-2---------------|-2-----0-----2---|
    |-0---------------|-3-----------3---|
    |-----------------|-----------------|

E11 = 022232

    (Thief on the cross,      chances are slim)

    There's a thief on the cross, his chances are slim
    There's thief on the cross, I want to talk to him

         C                  D
    Well everybody's been diverted,
         C                          D
    Everybody lookin' the other way
    C                           D
     Everybody's attention is divided
              C                 E11
    Well they may not afford to wait, well -

    There's a thief on the cross his chances are slim
    There's a thief on the cross I wanna talk to him

    Wanna ask him 'bout his mother
    Wanna ask him 'bout his world
    Wanna ask him 'bout to talk to himself
    If this time it didn't roll too well, well -

    There's a thief on the cross his chances are slim
    There's a thief on the cross I wanna talk to him

    Well, everybody know too excited [?]
    Don't be too surprised
    Head for the dawn and you can see it well
    And it's rising in his eyes, well -

    There's a thief on the cross his chances are slim
    There's a thief on the cross I wanna talk to him

    There's a thief on the cross, there's a thief on the cross

    Now there's winning, ruling and readin'
    Everybody goes [...]
    [every scene be] too excited
    Whether Iran or Mexico, well -

    There's a thief on the cross his chances are slim
    There's a thief on the cross I wanna talk to him.

    There's a thief on the cross,
    thief on the cross
    There's a thief on the cross,
    There's a thief on the cross,
    There's a thief on the cross
