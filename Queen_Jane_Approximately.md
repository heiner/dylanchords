    F . . . |Em . Dm . |C . Csus4 . |C . .

              F      Em         Dm           C       Csus4 C
    When your mother sends back all your invitations
             F              Em     Dm   G        /f /e /d
    And your father to your sister he explains
                C            F                    C        (/c /b /Bb) Am
    That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations
    C/g            F/g           C       F
    Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
    C              F(/g)         C
    Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?

    Now when all of the flower ladies want back what they have lent you
    And the smell of their roses does not remain
    And all of your children start to resent you
    Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
    Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?

    Now when all the clowns that you have commissioned
    Have died in battle or in vain
    And you're sick of all this repetition
    Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
    Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?

    When all of your advisers heave their plastic
    At your feet to convince you of your pain
    Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic
    Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
    Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?

    Now when all the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
    All lay down their bandanas and complain
    And you want somebody you don't have to speak to
    Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
    Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
