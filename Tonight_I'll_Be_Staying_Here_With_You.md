    G        C              G
    Throw my ticket out the window,
    G        C                   G
    Throw my suitcase out there, too,
             C        G/b     C
    Throw my troubles out the door,
            C         G/b Am
    I don't need them any more
           G               C                 G
    'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.

    I should have left this town this morning
    But it was more than I could do.
    Oh, your love comes on so strong
    And I've waited all day long
    For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.

    Cm                   G
    Is it really any wonder
    Cm                               G
    The love that a stranger might receive.
    Ab                             C
    You cast your spell and I went under,
    Am                        D      C  Bm  Am
    I find it so difficult to leave.

    I can hear that whistle blowin',
    I see that stationmaster, too,
    If there's a poor boy on the street,
    Then let him have my seat
    'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.

    [instrumental break]

    Throw my ticket out the window,
    Throw my suitcase out there, too,
    Throw my troubles out the door,
    I don't need them any more
    'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.

    G          C                  G
      Throw my ticket in the wind
    G          C                  G
      Throw my mattress out there too
            C       G/b    Am
    Draw my letters in the sand,
               C      G/b  Am
    'cause you got to understand
         G               C                 G       C/g    G
    that tonight I'll be staying here with you

    I could have left this town by noon
    by tonight I'd been to someplace new
    but I was feeling a little bit scattered
    and your love was all that mattered
    so tonight I'll be staying here with you, get ready,
    cause tonight I'll be staying here with you

      Is it really any wonder
    Ab                                   G
      the changes we put on each other's heads

    You came down on me like rolling thunder
    Am                             D   /c /b /a D(9)
      I left my dreams on the riverbed

    I can hear that lonesome whistle blowin'
    I hear them semis rolling too
    If there's a driver on the road
    let him have my load
    cause tonight I'll be staying here with you

    [instr. bridge]

    I can hear that lonesome whistle blowin'
    I hear them semis rolling too
    If there's a driver on this road
    then let him have my load
    'cause tonight I'll be staying here with you
    'cause tonight I'll be staying here with you
