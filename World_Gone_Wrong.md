Trad., arranged by Bob Dylan  
Released on [World Gone Wrong](World Gone Wrong "wikilink") (1993)  
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

* * * * *

Capo 2nd fret (Original key D major)

Chords:

    C       x32010
    Csus4   x33010
    Dm7-5   xx011x (Could also be called C+ or E+)
    Cmaj7   xx5500

The last line in every verse is given special treatment every time.
Sometimes he plays C F G C using only the strings 2, 3 and 4. Other
times he goes straight to an F after the Cmaj7. It's all mainly a
flourish anyway, so... And the riff that follows is just as variable.
This is in principle what he plays:

Riff 1:

      C                   G     C
      :   .   .   .   .   .     :
    |-0-1-3-1-----------------|-------
    |-0---3-----4---1---0-----|-1-----
    |-------------------0-----|-0-----
    |-------------------0-----|-2-----
    |-------------------------|-3-----
    |-------------------------|-------

In practice, it can take this form:

      C                F   Gsus4 C
      :   .   .   .    :   .     :   .
    |-0-1-3-1------------0-----|------
    |-0---3-0-r-4---h1---0---1-|------
    |---------0---0-h2---0-0-0-|------
    |-------------0-h3-----3-2-|------
    |--------------------------|-3----
    |------------------1-------|------

The turn at ‘I can’t be good no more’ goes like this:

      C       Dm7-5     F
      :   .   .   .     :   .
    |-----------------|---------
    |----(1)--1---0---|-1-------
    |----(0)--1-------|-2-------
    |----(2)--0-------|-3-------
    |----(3)----------|---------
    |-----------------|---------

It is also sometimes played where there is a \* in the tab.

    Strange things have happened like never before

    My baby told me I would have to go
      Dm7-5    F                  *      F
    I can't be good no more, once like I did before
      *        G
    I can't be good, baby
    Cmaj7                    C    F    G    C
    Honey, because the world gone wrong.

    [Riff 1]

    Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home
    No use in worrying cause the world gone wrong
    I can't be good no more, once, like I did before
    I can't be good baby
    Honey, because the world gone wrong.

    I told you baby, right to your head
    If I didn't leave you, I would have to kill you dead
    I can't be good no more, once, like I did before
    I can't be good baby
    Honey, cause the world gone wrong.

    I tried to be lovin', and treat you kind
    But it seem like you never right, you got no loyal mind
    I can't be good no more, once, like I did before
    I can't be good baby
    Honey, cause the world's gone wrong.

    If you had a woman and she don't treat you kind
    Praise the Good Lord to get her out of your mind
    I can't be good no more, once, like I did before
    I can't be good baby
    Honey, because the world gone wrong.

    Said, when you been good now, can't do no more
    Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door"
    I can't be good no more, once, like I did before
    I can't be good baby
    Honey, because the world's gone wrong.

    Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat
    No use to ask me baby, cause I'll never be back
    I can't be good no more, once, like I did before
    I can't be good baby.
    Honey, because the world gone wrong.
