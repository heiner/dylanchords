Hey, pretty mama

Well, I went down to Deep Ellem
On a one-way track
Woman took my money, boys,
and she never gave it back
Hey, pretty mama
Your daddy's got them Deep Ellem blues
Tell your brothers and your sisters
Your daddy's got them Deep Ellem blues.

When you go down to Deep Ellem
keep your money in your shoes
Them women in Deep Ellem give you
Deep Ellem blues
Hey, pretty mama
Your daddy's got them Deep Ellem blues
Tell your brothers and your sisters
Your daddy's got them Deep Ellem blues.
