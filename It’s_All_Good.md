Nothing much here, but I guess it’s all good. Or was it: it’s all G?

Calling it “G” is a little too simple, by the way. It's one half G, one
half Gm, one half G7, and the rest is an assortment of blues licks
around a G bass.

    G
    Talk about me babe, if you must

    Throw on the dust, pile on the dust

    I'd do the same thing if I could

    You know what they say, they say it's all good

    All good,

    It's all good

    Big politician telling lies
    Restaurant kitchen, all full of flies
    Don't make a bit of difference, don't see why it should
    But it's all right, 'cause it's all good
    It's all good
    It's all good

    Wives are leavin' their husbands, they beginning to roam
    They leave the party and they never get home
    I wouldn't change it, even if I could
    You know what they say man, it's all good,
    It's all good
    All good

    Brick by brick, they tear you down
    A teacup of water is enough to drown
    You ought to know, if they could they would
    Whatever going down, it's all good
    All good
    Say it's all good

    People in the country, people on the land
    Some of them so sick, they can hardly stand
    Everybody would move away, if they could
    It's hard to believe but it's all good
    Yeah

    The widow's cry, the orphan's plea
    Everywhere you look, more misery
    Come along with me, babe, I wish you would
    You know what I'm sayin', it's all good
    All good
    I said it's all good
    All good

    Cold blooded killer, stalking the town
    Cop cars blinking, something bad going down
    Buildings are crumbling in the neighborhood
    But there's nothing to worry about, 'cause it's all good
    It's all good
    They say it's all good

    I'll pluck off your beard and blow it in your face
    This time tomorrow I'll be rolling in your place
    I wouldn't change a thing even if I could
    You know what they say, they say it's all good
    It's all good
