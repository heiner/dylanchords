    G   D     G
    You angel you
        G      D          G
    You got me under your wing.
        G       D/f#         C/e     D
    The way you walk and the way you talk
      C            D      G
    I feel I could almost sing.

    You angel you
    You're as fine as anything's fine.
    I just want to watch you talk with your
    memory on my mind

        C                               G
    You know I can't sleep at night for trying
          G         D/f#      C/e    D
    Yes I never did feel this way before,
    G         D/f#       C/e     D
    Never did get up and walk the floor.
    G           D/f#     C/e    D
     If this is love then gimme more
        G
    And more and more and more (and more).

    You angel you
    You're as fine as can be
    The way you walk and the way you talk
    it's the way it ought to be

    You know I can't sleep at night for trying
    Never did feel this way before,
    Never did get up and walk the floor.
    If this is love then gimme more
    And more and more and more.

    You angel you
    You got me under your wing.
    The way you walk and the way you talk
    I swear it would make me sing.
