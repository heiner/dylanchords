    G             C         G
    Rock of ages, cleft for me,
                  D       G       C/g G
    let me hide myself in thee;
           D             G
    Oh,the water and the blood
              D                  G
    from this wounded side which flowed,
    G            C         G
    Rock of ages cleft for me
                  D       G
    let me hide myself in thee.

    While I draw this fleeting breath,
    when mine eyelids close in death,
    and I rush through worlds unknown
    and behold thee on that throne,
    Rock of ages, cleft for me,
    let me hide myself in thee

    Rock of ages, cleft for me,
    let me hide myself in thee
     G C/g     G
    [myself in thee]

Original lyrics

</h2>
    Rock of ages, cleft for me,
    let me hide myself in thee;
    let the water and the blood
    from thy wounded side which flowed,
    be of sin the double cure,
    cleanse me from its guilt and power.

    Not the labor of my hands
    can fulfill thy law's demands;
    could my zeal no respite know,
    could my tears forever flow,
    all for sin could not atone;
    thou must save, and thou alone.

    Nothing in my hand I bring,
    simply to the cross I cling;
    naked, come to thee for dress;
    helpless look to thee for grace;
    foul, I to the fountain fly;
    wash me, Savior, or I die.

    While I draw this fleeting breath,
    when mine eyelids close in death,
    when I soar through tracts unknown
    see thee on thy judgment throne,
    Rock of ages, cleft for me,
    let me hide myself in thee.
