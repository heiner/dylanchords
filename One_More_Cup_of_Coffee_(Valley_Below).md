         Am
    Your breath is sweet
                           G
    Your eyes are like two jewels in the sky.
         F
    Your back is straight, your hair is smooth
           E
    On the pillow where you lie.
        Am
    But I don't sense affection
       G
    No gratitude or love
         F
    Your loyalty is not to me
        E
    But to the stars above.

    F                              E
    One more cup of coffee for the road,
    F                              E
    One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
                  Am
    To the valley below.

    Your daddy he's an outlaw
    And a wanderer by trade
    He'll teach you how to pick and choose
    And how to throw the blade.
    He oversees his kingdom
    So no stranger does intrude
    His voice it trembles as he calls out
    For another plate of food.

    One more cup of coffee for the road,
    One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
    To the valley below.

    Your sister sees the future
    Like your mama and yourself.
    You've never learned to read or write
    There's no books upon your shelf.
    And your pleasure knows no limits
    Your voice is like a meadowlark
    But your heart is like an ocean
    Mysterious and dark.

    One more cup of coffee for the road,
    One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
    To the valley below.

    Your breath is sweet

    Your eyes are like two jewels in the sky.
         Eb
    Your back is straight, your hair is smooth
           D
    On the pillow where you lie.
        Gm
    But I don't sense affection
       F
    No gratitude or love
         Eb

    To the valley below.
