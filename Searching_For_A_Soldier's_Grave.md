Written by Jim Anglin (1913-1987), who sold the copyrights to Roy Acuff
(this was the case even with [This World Can't Stand
Long](This World Can't Stand Long); it's been recorded by The
Blue Sky Boys, Hank Williams, et al., and by Ralph Stanley(on *Pray For
The Boys*), which is probably the source of Dylan's version.

Performed by Bob Dylan on various occasions since the first performance
in Portland, OR, Jun 15 2000  
Tabbed and transcribed by Eyolf Østrem (who personally thinks it's a
rather silly song...) (although Hank Williams considered it “one of the
purdyest songs I reckon anybody ever wrote” – “all for poppa during
WWII”)

    You ask me, stranger, why I make this journey
    C                                           G
    Why I cross three thousand miles of rolling waves.
         C                                    F
    Like so many others my love was killed in action.
    C           G                 C
    So I'm here searching for his grave.

    Somewhere among the many thousand
    Of all the Americans who died, true and brave,
    That's where I know I'll find him resting
    So I'm here searching for his grave.

    Beside each crossmark there all around me
    I'll kneel down and gladly say a prayer
    For all the dear loved ones home across the ocean
    Whose hearts like mine lie buried over here.

    Somewhere among the many dozens
    Of all the Americans who died true and brave
    That's where I know I'll find him resting
    So I'm here searching for his grave.
