<pre class="refrain">
G
I am the Man, Thomas

I am the Man

Look at these nail scars
D          G
Here in my hand
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
G
They drove me up the hill, Thomas

I am the Man

They made me carry the cross, Thomas
D        G
I am the Man
</pre>

<pre class="refrain">
I am the Man, Thomas
I am the Man
Look at these nail scars
Here in my hand
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
They crowned my head with thorns, Thomas
I am the Man
They nailed me to the cross, Thomas
I am the Man
</pre>

<pre class="refrain">
I am the Man, Thomas
I am the Man
Look at these nail scars
Here in my hand
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
They pierced me in the side
I am the Man
I died on the cross, Thomas
I am the Man
</pre>

<pre class="refrain">
I am the Man, Thomas
I am the Man
Look at these nails scars
Here in my hand
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
They buried me in the tomb, Thomas
I am the Man
In three days I rose, Thomas
I am the Man
</pre>

<pre class="refrain">
I am the Man, Thomas
I am the Man
Look at these nails scars
Here in my hand
</pre>

Dylan seems to have combined verse two and three into the following:

<pre class="quote verse">
They pierced my side with thorns, Thomas
I am the Man
They made me carry the cross, Thomas
I am the Man
</pre>

It's hard to work out exactly, though (Bob apparently thought so
too). Suggestions for words instead of thorns are: forks, pork and,
more plausible, swords. At one show the third line was, I believe,
sung:

<pre class="quote verse">They drove me off a cliff, Thomas
</pre>
