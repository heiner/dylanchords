    G
    I am the Man, Thomas

    I am the Man

    Look at these nail scars
    D          G
    Here in my hand

    G
    They drove me up the hill, Thomas

    I am the Man

    They made me carry the cross, Thomas
    D        G
    I am the Man

    I am the Man, Thomas
    I am the Man
    Look at these nail scars
    Here in my hand

    They crowned my head with thorns, Thomas
    I am the Man
    They nailed me to the cross, Thomas
    I am the Man

    I am the Man, Thomas
    I am the Man
    Look at these nail scars
    Here in my hand

    They pierced me in the side
    I am the Man
    I died on the cross, Thomas
    I am the Man

    I am the Man, Thomas
    I am the Man
    Look at these nails scars
    Here in my hand

    They buried me in the tomb, Thomas
    I am the Man
    In three days I rose, Thomas
    I am the Man

    I am the Man, Thomas
    I am the Man
    Look at these nails scars
    Here in my hand

Dylan seems to have combined verse two and three into the following:

    They pierced my side with thorns, Thomas
    I am the Man
    They made me carry the cross, Thomas
    I am the Man

It's hard to work out exactly, though (Bob apparently thought so too).
Suggestions for words instead of thorns are: forks, pork and, more
plausible, swords. At one show the third line was, I believe, sung:

    They drove me off a cliff, Thomas
