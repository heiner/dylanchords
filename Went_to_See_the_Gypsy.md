Words and music Bob Dylan  
Released on [New Morning](/wiki/New Morning "wikilink") (1970)  
Tabbed by Eyolf Ã˜strem

Piano song. I shamelessly suggest a capo on the 3rd fret (sounding key
Bb major).  
Quite complicated, being such a simple (dull?) song.

    G    Am    G   Am

    Am               G
     Went to see the gypsy,
    Am                  G
     Stayin' in a big hotel.
       Am                    G
    He smiled when he saw me coming,
                 Am                   D
    And he said, "Well, well, well."
                          G
    His room was dark and crowded,
    Am                  G
    Lights were low and dim.
            C     G/b Am     G
    How are you?" he said to me,
      Am
    I said it back to him.

    D             G
      I went down to the lobby
    Am                    G
     To make a small call out.
    Am
     A pretty dancing girl was there,

    And she began to shout,
           D               G
    "Go on back to see the gypsy.
           Am           (Bm) G     [piano bass line: c  b  a  g]
    He can move you from the rear,
    C         G/b  Am   G
    Drive you from your fear,
    C         G/b     Am  G
    Bring you through the mirror.
       C      G/b    Am G
    He did it in Las Vegas,
        Am
    And he can do it here."

    F                             G
    Outside the lights were shining
           F        F
    On the river of tears,
      F                     G
    I watched them from the distance
         C           Am
    With music in my ears.

           D               G
    I went back to see the gypsy,
           Am     D     G
    It was nearly early dawn.
        Am               G
    The gypsy's door was open wide
            Am
    But the gypsy was gone,
             D              G
    And that pretty dancing girl,
    Am               G
    She could not be found.
         C            G/b      Am
    So I watched that sun come rising
    G         Am
    From that little Minnesota town,
              D                G
    From that little Minnesota town.
