Written by Bob Dylan  
Performed occasionally during the European 1984 tour, always with a
different set of lyrics  
Tabbed and transcribed by Eyolf Ã˜strem

* * * * *

I present attempts at transcriptions of three different performances.
The lyrics changed from night to night, so perhaps one shouldn't expect
to be able to make a perfect transcription. Still, if you have
additions/corrections to the lyrics below, please send them in.

The prominent descent in the verses can be played like this:

      G7   Gdim  Cm6/g   G
    |--7--|--6--|--5--|--3--|
    |--6--|--5--|--4--|--3--|
    |--7--|--6--|--5--|--4--|
    |--5--|--5--|--5--|--5--|
    |-----|-----|-----|-----|
    |-----|-----|-----|-----|

Since the whole sequence is simply a dragged-out turnaround over a
sustained bass, any turnaround figure will do.

    G7
    Hands off your feet, baby,
    Gdim
    listen to this
    Cm6/g                G
    This is what I can't be
    G7
    Often it hurt me honey, I'm
    Gdim
    looking at you but
    Cm6/g                G
    You're looking at me too.

              C
    Because a dollar is a dollar
                               G
    And the downtown boys play rough
       D
    Go all the way back, baby
              C         G     D
    Tell 'em enough is enough.

    Face on the gutter baby,
    which is which but I'd
    rather be lucky than be rich
    Off with the money honey
    that is true, but I'm
    Satisfied with you.

    'cause a dollar is a dollar
    And the downtown boys play rough
    Go all the way back, baby
    Tell 'em enough is enough.

    All cities, honey, hard, is
    soakin' wet, but there's
    no more gold you can get
    [...] I'm
    facin' the wall, but
    baby you took it all.

    Because a dollar is a dollar
    And the downtown boys play rough
    You tell 'em baby,
    That enough is enough.

    Got a gold mining fever, baby, but, ah
    which is which, but I'd
    Rather be lucky than be rich
    [...]
    that is true, but I'm
    satisfied with you

    Because a dollar is a dollar
    And the downtown boys play rough
    Go all the way back, baby
    Tell 'em enough is enough.

    Got a gold mining fever baby, which is which but
    I'd rather be lucky than be rich
    Go off with the money honey, that is true, but I'm
    Satisfied with you.

Paris, Jul 1 1984

</h2>
    Well, I don't mind eating funny honey,
    sleep down in the ditch, but I'd
    rather be lucky than be rich
    [well, all the time I'm]
    soakin' wet, but
    you got all the gold that you gonna get

    Because a dollar is a dollar
    And the downtown boys play rough
    Go all the way back, baby
    Tell 'em enough is enough.

    [Fall through the sugar, I
    Fall through the glue], but I'm
    Satisfied with you
    [oh, Moneypenny, I
    should let it go, so I
    just wanna know our show]

    Because a dollar is a dollar
    And the downtown boys play rough
    Go all the way back, baby
    Tell 'em enough is enough.

    [...
    ...show]
    Go back as far as you can go
    I don't mind honey, 'bout
    Sleepin' in the ditch, tell 'em you'd
    rather be lucky than be rich

    Because a dollar is a dollar
    And the downtown boys play rough
    Go all the way back, baby
    Tell 'em enough is enough.

Wembley, Jul 7, 1984

</h2>
    Hold your seat, honey,
    back in the ditch, cause I'd
    rather be lucky than be rich
    Oh, yeah, [...
    ...]
    I love you, and that is all.

    Because a dollar is a dollar
    And the downtown boys play rough
    Go all the way back, baby,
    tell 'em enough is enough.

    [...] motor, honey,
    up and down the line,
    you tell them that you are mine
    [if they heard of you I
    must obey,]
    you tell them you belong to me

    Because a dollar is a dollar
    And the downtown boys play rough
    Go all the way back, baby,
    tell 'em enough is enough.

    She's from love, honey,
    back against the wall, but
    you all had it done, got it all.
    Oh, pretty honey, I
    tell her you're sick but I
    wish you'd do it mighty quick

    Because a dollar is a dollar
    And the downtown boys sure play rough
    Go all the way back, baby,
    tell 'em enough is enough.

    Oh let me see if the
    face is soaking wet,
    you already got what you gonna get
    If they ever ask you to
    sleep in the ditch, you tell 'em
    you'd rather be lucky than be rich.

    Because a dollar is a dollar
    And the downtown boys sure play rough
    Now, go all the way back, baby,
    tell 'em enough is enough.
