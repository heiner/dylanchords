Written by Bob Dylan<br>
Released on [[Self Portrait]] (1970), probably the only Dylan album
which has never been underestimated (enough)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Ã˜strem (there is actually a little finesse here
which justifies the term)

Emsus4 (that's the finesse) is played 022010 (or at least it sounds as
if there is a c there somewhere; it's probably just an overtone
somewhere, and played as a straight Em chord. So much for finesse. . .)

C                    Am
All the tired horses in the sun
Em                          G
How'm I supposed to get any ridin' done?
C      Am
Hmm.
Emsus4 G
Hmm.   Hmm.
