Written by Bob Dylan  
Released on [Self Portrait](/wiki/Self Portrait "wikilink") (1970), probably
the only Dylan album which has never been underestimated (enough)  
Tabbed by Eyolf Ã˜strem (there is actually a little finesse here which
justifies the term)

Emsus4 (that's the finesse) is played 022010 (or at least it sounds as
if there is a c there somewhere; it's probably just an overtone
somewhere, and played as a straight Em chord. So much for finesse. . .)

    C                    Am
    All the tired horses in the sun
    Em                          G
    How'm I supposed to get any ridin' done?
    C      Am
    Hmm.
    Emsus4 G
    Hmm.   Hmm.
