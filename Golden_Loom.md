    G

    n.c.         G
    Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,

    I see the sailin' boats across the bay go by.
               C
    Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
                       G
    And then I turn my head, for you're approachin' me.
    Am                      Bm                    C                 D
    Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter, floatin' in to my room
                  G
    With a golden loom.

    First we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
    And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.
    I see the hungry clouds up above your face
    And then the tears roll down, what a bitter taste.
    And then you drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
    With your golden loom.

    I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
    Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night.
    I see the trembling lion with the lotus flower tail
    And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil.
    But you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
    And your golden loom.
