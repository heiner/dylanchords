This song sounds deceptively simple, but man are there lots of things
going on here!

First there's this two-chord thing going, throughout the whole song,
that's either brilliantly persistent or driving you crazy -- probably
depending on what mood you're in:

    F     C
    :   .   .   .     :   .   .   .
    ||------------------|-----------------||
    ||<nowiki>*</nowiki>-6-----5---------|----------------<nowiki>*</nowiki>||
    ||--5-----5---------|-----------------||
    ||--7-----5---------|-----------------||
    ||<nowiki>*</nowiki>-----------------|----------------<nowiki>*</nowiki>||
    ||------------------|-----------------||

    F     C                   G         C
    :   .   .   .     :   .   .   .     :   .   .   .
    |-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
    |-6-----5---------|---------3-------|-----------------|
    |-5-----5---------|---------4-------|-5---------------|
    |-7-----5---------|---------5-------|-5---------------|
    |-----------------|-----------------|-7---------------|
    |-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|

But then there's the chord sequence that is played by the Django-ish
acoustic guitar somewhere to the left:

    | C . . . | F . .     . | C . . . | F . Dm/f Fm |
    | C . . . | . . Csus4 . | C . . . | . . .    .  |

And finally the bass line, which adds more complexity to the gumbo (and
for the sake of simplicity, I give all the tabs relative to a third-fret
capo, even though that's of course not what Tony Garnier is actually
playing):

    C                 F                 C                 Dm7-5
    :   .   .   .     :   .   .   .     :   .   .   .     :   .   .   .
    |-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
    |-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
    |-----------------|-------------0---|---------0---0---|---------1---1---|
    |---------2---2---|-3---3---4-------|-----------------|-3---3-----------|
    |-3---3-----------|-----------------|-3---3-----------|-----------------|
    |-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|

    C6      Am        Dm      G7        C                 D7      G7
    :   .   .   .     :   .   .   .     :   .   .   .     :   .   .   .
    |-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
    |-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
    |-2---2---2-------|---------0---0---|-----------------|-----------------|
    |-------------2---|-0---0-----------|---------2---2---|-0---0-----------|
    |-----------------|-----------------|-3---3-----------|-----------------|
    |-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------3---3---|

Feel free to pick and choose your own level of complexity.

    C              F                C        F   Dm7-5
    Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
    C       Am              Dm       G7     C     D7   G7
    Blowing like it's gonna sweep my world away
    C             F                C     F    Dm7-5
    I'm gonna stop in Carbondale and keep on going
    C        Am          Dm      G7        C
    That Duquesne train gonna ride me night and day
    C9                     F
    You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp
    D7                   G7
    But I ain't neither one
    C              F                C        F   Dm7-5
    Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
    C      Am        Dm   G7    C
    Sounds like it's on a final run.

    Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
    Blowing like she never blowed before
    Blue light blinking, red light glowing
    Blowing like she's at my chamber door
    You're smiling through the fence at me
    Just like you've always smiled before
    Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
    Blowing like she ain't gonna blow no more.

    Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing
    Blowing like the sky's gonna blow apart
    You're the only thing alive that keeps me going
    You're like a time-bomb in my heart
    I can hear a sweet voice gently calling
    Must be the Mother of Our Lord
    Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
    Blowing like my woman's on board.

    Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
    Blowing like it's gonna blow my blues away
    You old rascal, I know exactly where you're going
    I'll lead you there myself at the break of day
    I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed
    Everybody telling me she's gone to my head
    Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
    Blowing like it's gonna kill me dead.

    C    G    F   Am
    F    C/e  G

    Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing
    Blowing through another no-good town
    The lights of my native land are glowing
    I wonder if they'll know me next time round
    I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing
    That old oak tree, the one we used to climb
    Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
    Blowing like she's blowing right on time.
