          D                          /c#
    I was listening to the voices of death on parade
    /c                                G
    Singin' about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid
    Gm6                             D
    Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust
    Asus4                                     A
    Suffering ridicule and wanting to give it all up in disgust.

        D  G           D
    But you changed my life
    D          G            A
    Came along in a time of strife
       G                   D
    In hunger and need you made my heart bleed
    D   A          D
    You changed my life.

    Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired
    They got a million things to do, they're all so inspired
    You do the work of the devil you got a million friends
    They'll be there when you got something, they'll take it all in the end.

    But you changed my life
    Came along in a time of strife
    In hunger and need you made my heart bleed
    You changed my life.

    When the nature of man is to beg and to steal
    I do it myself, it's not so unreal
    The call of the wild's forever at my door
    Want me to fly like an eagle while being chained to the floor.

    But you changed my life
    Came along in a time of strife
    In hunger and need you made my heart bleed
    You changed my life.

    When I was eatin' with the pigs off a fancy tray
    I was told I was lookin' good and to have a nice day
    It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite
    Eatin' that obsolete garbage while being so discreet.

    But you changed my life
    Came along in a time of strife
    In hunger and need you made my heart bleed
    You changed my life.

    You were glowing in the sun while being peaceable calm
    While orphans of man dance to the beat of the palm
    You eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass
    In the world you had made they had made you an outcast.

    But you changed my life
    Came along in a time of strife
    In hunger and need you made my heart bleed
    You changed my life.

    There's someone in my body that I could hardly see
    Invading my privacy making my decisions for me
    Holding me back, not letting me stand
    Making me feel like a stranger in a strange land.

    But you changed my life
    Came along in a time of strife
    In hunger and need you made my heart bleed
    You changed my life.

    My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend
    Heart"fixer, mind"regulator, true to the end
    My creator my comforter my cause for joy
    While the world is set against what will never destroy.

    But you changed my life
    Came along in a time of strife
    In hunger and need you made my heart bleed
    You changed my life.
