         Am              C    G           F                 Am
    When first I came to Louisville, some pleasure there to find,
                        C     G       F              Am
    A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind.
        F                     G          Am     /g         Am
    Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips, like arrows pierced my breast
                          C  G       F           Am
    The name she bore was Flora, the Lily of the West.

                               C  G       F           Am
    (And the name she bore was Flora, the Lily of the West.)

    I courted lovely Flora, some pleasure for to find,
    But she turned unto another man, which sore distressed my mind.
    She robbed me of my liberty, deprived me off my rest --
    Then go, my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.

    (Then go, my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.)

    'Way down in yonder shady grove, a man of high degree
    Conversing with my Flora there, which seemed so strange to me.
    And the answer that she gave to him, it sore did me opress
    I was betrayed by Flora, the Lily of the West.

    (I was betrayed by Flora, the Lily of the West.)

    I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand.
    I seized him by the collar, and boldly made him stand.
    Being mad by desperation, I pierced him through the breast
    All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.

    (All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.)

    I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea;
    They placed me in the witness box, and then commenced on me.
    Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest
    Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West.

    (Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West.)
