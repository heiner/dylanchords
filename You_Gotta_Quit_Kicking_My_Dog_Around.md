Every time I go to town  
the boys keep kicking my dog around  
Don't know why I'm going to town  
I don't know why they kick my dog around

let me hear you now:

(dog, dog, dog  
dog, dog, dog  
dog, dog, dog  
why, why, why  
why, why, why  
why, why, why  
why, why, why)

Every time I go to town  
the boys keep kicking my dog around  
I don't know why I'm going to town  
I don't know why they kick my dog around

(dog, dog, dog) yes, yes, yes  
(why, why, why) oh-ho  
(dog, dog, dog) why, why, why  
(why, why, why) dog around

Every time I go and get a meal  
I can see the boys they're planning to steal  
My here dog, he's waggin' his tail  
he helps me pick up the morning mail (bark, bark, bark)

Every time I go to town  
the boys keep kicking my dog around (kick, kick, kick)  
I don't know why they kick my dog around  
I just keep go-oing to town (bark, bark, bark)

I don't know why  
(why, why, why) I don't know bark  
(dog, dog, dog) I don't know why  
(bark, bark, bark) bark-a bark, bark  
(quack, quack, quack) duck, duck, duck  
(duttuduttudu) pig pig pig  
(...) fuck fuck fuck  
(bark bark bark) dig dig dig
