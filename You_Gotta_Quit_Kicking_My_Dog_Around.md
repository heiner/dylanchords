Words and music Bob Dylan<br>

Played over a sustained G with a capo on the 2nd fret, and with
occasional G-C/g-G embellishments.

----
Every time I go to town<br>
the boys keep kicking my dog around<br>
Don't know why I'm going to town<br>
I don't know why they kick my dog around

let me hear you now:

(dog, dog, dog<br>
dog, dog, dog<br>
dog, dog, dog<br>
why, why, why<br>
why, why, why<br>
why, why, why<br>
why, why, why)

Every time I go to town<br>
the boys keep kicking my dog around<br>
I don't know why I'm going to town<br>
I don't know why they kick my dog around

(dog, dog, dog) yes, yes, yes<br>
(why, why, why) oh-ho<br>
(dog, dog, dog) why, why, why<br>
(why, why, why) dog around

Every time I go and get a meal<br>
I can see the boys they're planning to steal<br>
My here dog, he's waggin' his tail<br>
he helps me pick up the morning mail (bark, bark, bark)

Every time I go to town<br>
the boys keep kicking my dog around (kick, kick, kick)<br>
I don't know why they kick my dog around <br>
I just keep go-oing to town (bark, bark, bark)

I don't know why <br>
(why, why, why) I don't know bark<br>
(dog, dog, dog) I don't know why<br>
(bark, bark, bark) bark-a bark, bark<br>
(quack, quack, quack) duck, duck, duck<br>
(duttuduttudu) pig pig pig<br>
(...) fuck fuck fuck<br>
(bark bark bark) dig dig dig
