Introductory Remarks

<em>Down in the Groove </em>came at a time when Dylan wasn't exactly at
the zenith of his powers as a recording artist. His struggles with the
modern recording techniques (at the time mostly resulting in lost
battles), as well as a steadily decreasing audience since his religious
trilogy, hadn't been good for his reputation. And <em>Down in the Groove
</em>didn't make things much better.

It is probably one of the last albums people buy. And in my most
critical moments I'm inclined to say: “And for good reason.” But still:
the album has qualities, not only compared with <em>Knocked out
Loaded</em>, which only has <em>one</em> quality (“Brownsville Girl”).

I'll return to the qualities in a moment. First a general overview: The
six first songs, and eight out of ten songs on the album as a whole, are
in the key of A major, most of them are fairly standard 12-bar blues,
with slight variations (such as the F\#m in [Had A Dream About You,
Baby](/wiki/Had A Dream About You, Baby "wikilink"), which in this case is
counterbalanced by the rather monotonous singing)(I didn't say it was
bad, though). The main difference between [Let's Stick
Together](/wiki/Let's Stick Together "wikilink"), [Sally Sue
Brown](/wiki/Sally Sue Brown "wikilink"), [Had A Dream About You,
Baby](/wiki/Had A Dream About You, Baby "wikilink") and [Ugliest Girl In The
World](/wiki/Ugliest Girl In The World "wikilink") is the titles.

[Death Is Not The End](/wiki/Death Is Not The End "wikilink") is, I think, the
only Dylan song that has left a really bad taste in my mouth. It was a
general joking subject around here, until someone wanted to borrow the
album to play this song in his wife's funeral. They had heard it on the
radio a few days before she died, probably the only time it was ever
played on the radio. I pass her gravestone every day on my way to work.
It hasn't changed my opinion about the song, I just don't laugh about it
anymore.

[Silvio](/wiki/Silvio "wikilink") is a strange song in many ways. The lyrics
by Grateful Dead-lyricist Robert Hunter are often referred to as typical
Dylan-wannabe-writing. Be that as it may – on this album it compares
favourably not only to the non-Dylan songs. For a very long time it was
the regular ending of the first electric set of just about every show,
which added to its strangeness: a song that for tape-collectors was a
nuisance and a drag, as the eternal song no. 5, but which most others
had never heard – who had got <em>Down in the Groove</em> apart from the
collectors (the song request of all times: in Stockholm, June 9 1998
someone yelled out “SILVIO” after song nr. 4)?

Musically it is a carbon copy of <em>Isis</em>. That's perhaps not where
the real genious of <em>Isis</em> lies, but it's a persistent little
bugger of a riff.

The songs that are neither square rock'n'roll in A or “Death is not the
end”, go to the other opposite – three of them are played in a very
loose rhythm ([When Did You Leave
Heaven?](/wiki/When Did You Leave Heaven? "wikilink"),
[Shenandoah](/wiki/Shenandoah "wikilink"), [Ninety Miles An Hour (Down A Dead
End Street)](/wiki/Ninety Miles An Hour (Down A Dead End Street) "wikilink")).
These are not only standing out, they are really outstanding. Sure
enough, the drumming on “When did you leave heaven” is a bit strange,
but that's forgiveable. “Ninety miles” is a perfect example of how to
create an intensive pulse (quite fitting the lyrics) without a drum or
even a fixed rhythm.

One song left, one performance, and what a performance! [Rank Strangers
To Me](/wiki/Rank Strangers To Me "wikilink") is one of the reasons to have
this one on CD – not because of the sound, but

because of the repeat button.
