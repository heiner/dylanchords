Introductory Remarks

*Down in the Groove* came at a time when Dylan wasn't exactly at
the zenith of his powers as a recording artist. His struggles with the
modern recording techniques (at the time mostly resulting in lost
battles), as well as a steadily decreasing audience since his religious
trilogy, hadn't been good for his reputation. And *Down in the Groove*
didn't make things much better.

It is probably one of the last albums people buy. And in my most
critical moments I'm inclined to say: “And for good reason.” But still:
the album has qualities, not only compared with *Knocked out
Loaded*, which only has *one* quality (“Brownsville Girl”).

I'll return to the qualities in a moment. First a general overview: The
six first songs, and eight out of ten songs on the album as a whole, are
in the key of A major, most of them are fairly standard 12-bar blues,
with slight variations (such as the F\#m in [Had A Dream About You,
Baby](Had A Dream About You, Baby), which in this case is
counterbalanced by the rather monotonous singing)(I didn't say it was
bad, though). The main difference between [Let's Stick
Together](Let's Stick Together), [Sally Sue
Brown](Sally Sue Brown), [Had A Dream About You,
Baby](Had A Dream About You, Baby) and [Ugliest Girl In The
World](Ugliest Girl In The World) is the titles.

[Death Is Not The End](Death Is Not The End) is, I think, the
only Dylan song that has left a really bad taste in my mouth. It was a
general joking subject around here, until someone wanted to borrow the
album to play this song in his wife's funeral. They had heard it on the
radio a few days before she died, probably the only time it was ever
played on the radio. I pass her gravestone every day on my way to work.
It hasn't changed my opinion about the song, I just don't laugh about it
anymore.

[Silvio](Silvio) is a strange song in many ways. The lyrics
by Grateful Dead-lyricist Robert Hunter are often referred to as typical
Dylan-wannabe-writing. Be that as it may – on this album it compares
favourably not only to the non-Dylan songs. For a very long time it was
the regular ending of the first electric set of just about every show,
which added to its strangeness: a song that for tape-collectors was a
nuisance and a drag, as the eternal song no. 5, but which most others
had never heard – who had got *Down in the Groove* apart from the
collectors (the song request of all times: in Stockholm, June 9 1998
someone yelled out “SILVIO” after song nr. 4)?

Musically it is a carbon copy of *Isis*. That's perhaps not where
the real genious of *Isis* lies, but it's a persistent little
bugger of a riff.

The songs that are neither square rock'n'roll in A or “Death is not the
end”, go to the other opposite – three of them are played in a very
loose rhythm ([When Did You Leave
Heaven?](When Did You Leave Heaven?),
[Shenandoah](Shenandoah), [Ninety Miles An Hour (Down A Dead
End Street)](Ninety Miles An Hour (Down A Dead End Street))).
These are not only standing out, they are really outstanding. Sure
enough, the drumming on “When did you leave heaven” is a bit strange,
but that's forgiveable. “Ninety miles” is a perfect example of how to
create an intensive pulse (quite fitting the lyrics) without a drum or
even a fixed rhythm.

One song left, one performance, and what a performance! [Rank Strangers
To Me](Rank Strangers To Me) is one of the reasons to have
this one on CD – not because of the sound, but

because of the repeat button.
