    I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow
    I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow
    I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow
    I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow
    I'm going where the crackles/climate suit my clothes.

    Honey baby don't leave me now
    Honey baby don't leave me now
    Oh honey baby don't leave me now
    Honey baby don't leave me now
    I got trouble in my mind.

    Listen to that cold whistle blow, Lord
    Listen to that cold whistle blow
    Listen to that cold whistle blow
    Listen to that cold whistle blow
    I'm a-going where I never been before.

    So I got those worried blues, Lord
    I got those worried blues
    I got those worried blues
    I got those worried blues
    I'm going where I never been before.
