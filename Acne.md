Written by Eric von Schmidt (probably – anyway, it's probably not
what he considers his major contribution to humanity either, so he may
be able to forgive me if the attribution is wrong)<br>
Performed by Dylan and Ramblin' Jack Elliott at the Riverside Church,
Jul 29 1961<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

The Do-wap thing is Elliott's assigned role throughout the song.<br>
Things get a little out of hand towards the end of the song; I've
indicated the chords in the third verse

They don't think it to major at all
