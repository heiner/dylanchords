    D           C         G           Em
    Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
    D              C           G           Em
     We sit beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
    F#m        Em/g             F#m/a             Em/g
     Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream,
    D            C                  G         F#m    /a G
     Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream.

    D            C                   G             Em      A
    Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-lookin',
    D              C                 G        Em         A
     We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cookin',
    G                A(sus4 A) G                  A
     Starin' out the window     to the stars high above,
    G           F#m                Asus4         A
    Time passes slowly when you're searchin' for love.

    [short, glorious piano break]

    G                          D
     Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
    G                             D
     Ain't no reason to go to the fair.
             G                         D
    Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
    Asus4                 A   Asus4    A
     Ain't no reason to go anywhere.

    Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
    D                  C            G          Em
    We stare straight ahead and try so hard to stay right,
    Asus4                  G           Asus4         G
      Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day,

    Time passes slowly and fades away.
