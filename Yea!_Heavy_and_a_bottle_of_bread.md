Words and music Bob Dylan  
Released on [The Basement Tapes](The Basement Tapes)
(1967/1975)  
Tabbed by Eyolf Ã˜strem

The only difference between the two takes (apart from minor lyric
changes) is that in the officially released version the G is embellished
by a G6 (320000) first.

    The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
           A                                  G6        G
    On the very next day, with a nose full of pus.

    It's a one-track town, just brown, and a breeze, too,
    Pack up the meat, sweet, we're headin' out
    For Wichita in a pile of fruit.

    Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout
    Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout
    Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout

    Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle.
    Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it.
    Slap that drummer with a pie that smells.

    Take me down to California, baby
    Take me down to California, baby
    Take me down to California, baby

    Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus.
    The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
    On the very next day, with a nose full of pus.

    Yea! Heavy and a bottle of bread
    Yea! Heavy and a bottle of bread
                     G         A
    Yea! Heavy and a bottle of bread
