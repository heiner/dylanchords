Open D tuning, capo 5th fret (sounding key G major)

Chords:

    D    000000
    G/d  020100
    D(3) 054300 or 004300 or 004350
    D/f# 404300
    A7   x02100 or x02140
    A    777777

The playing on this one is really very simple, but he's playing around
with the basic elements (both the chord shapes, the rhythms and the
chord sequences) in a way that makes it look complicated on paper.  
Concerning the D(3) chord (i.e. D in the third position, i.e. beginning
in the 3rd fret), the first fingering (054300) is to be preferred when
it replaces the D-G/d-D figure, as in the second verse, and the second
or third (004350) when it is played in the succession D-A7-D. The
fingering D(3)=004300 goes with A7=002100, and D(3)=004350 with
A7=002140.  
I've written out the chords to the first three verses, which I think
cover most of the variants in the handling of this song.

The rhythm in the D-G/d-D parts varies between straight beats and
syncopated hammer-ons:

      D       G/d            D     G/d
      :   .   .   .          :   .   .   .
    |-0---0---0---0---|    |-0---0-----0-0---|
    |-0---0---0---0---|    |-0---0-----0-0---|
    |-0---0---1---1---| or |-0---0h1---1-1---|
    |-0---0---0---0---|    |-0---0-----0-0---|
    |-0---0---2---2---|    |-0---0h2---2-2---|
    |-0---0---0---0---|    |-0---0-----0-0---|
