    Em
    As I walked out tonight in the mystic garden,

    The wounded flowers were dangling from the vine,
          Am                                         *)
    I was passin' by yon cool crystal fountain,
    Em
      Someone hit me from behind.

      passin' by  yon   cool    crystal fountain

          Em
    Ain't talkin', just walkin'
                   Am            Em
    Through this weary world of woe.

    Heart burnin', still yearnin'
       B5     D5add9           Em
    No one on earth would ever know.

    They say prayer has the power to heal, so pray for me, mother.
    In the human heart, an evil spirit will dwell.
    I am a-tryin' to love my neighbor and do good unto others,
    But oh mother things ain't goin' well.

    Ain't talkin', just walkin'
    I'll burn that bridge before you can cross.
    Heart burnin', still yearnin'
    There'll be no mercy for you once you've lost.

    Now I'm all worn down by weeping,
    My eyes are filled with tears, my lips are dry.
    If I catch my opponents ever sleeping,
    I'll just slaughter'em where they lie.

    Ain't talkin', just walkin'
    Through the world mysterious and vague.
    Heart burnin', still yearnin'
    Walkin' through the cities of the plague.

    Well, the whole world is filled with speculation,
    The whole wide world which people say is round.
    They will tear your mind away from contemplation,
    They will jump on your misfortune when you're down.

    Ain't talkin', just walkin'
    Eatin' hog-eyed grease in a hog-eyed town.
    Heart burnin', still yearnin'
    Some day you'll be glad to have me around.

    They will crush you with wealth and power
    Every waking moment you could crack.
    I'll make the most of one last extra hour,
    I'll avenge my father's death when I step back.

    Ain't talkin', just walkin'
    Hand me down my walkin' cane.
    Heart burnin', still yearnin'
    Got to get you out of my miserable brain.

    All my loyal and my much-loved companions
    They approve of me and share my code
    I practice a faith that's been long abandoned
    Ain't no altars on this long and lonesome road

    Ain't talkin', just walkin'
    My mule is sick, my horse is blind.
    Heart burnin', still yearnin'
    Thinkin' 'bout that gal I left behind.

    Well, it's bright in the heavens and the wheels are flyin',
    Fame and honor never seem to fade.
    The fire gone out but the light is never dyin'.
    Who says I can't get heavenly aid'

    Ain't talkin', just walkin'
    Carryin' a dead man's seal.
    Heart burnin', still yearnin'
    Walkin' with a toothache in my heel.

    The suffering is unending;
    Every nook and cranny has its tears.
    I'm not playing, I'm not pretending,
    I'm not nursing any superfluous fears.

    Ain't talkin', just walkin'
    Walkin' ever since the other night.
    Heart burnin', still yearnin'
    Walkin' till I'm clean out of sight.

    As I walked out in the mystic garden
    On a hot summer day, a hot summer lawn.
    Excuse me, ma'am, I beg your pardon:
    There's no one here, the gardener is gone.

    Ain't talkin', just walkin'
    Up the road, around the bend.
    Heart burnin', still yearnin'
    In the last outback at the world's end.
