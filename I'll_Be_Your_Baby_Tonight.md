<pre class="verse">
           F
Close your eyes, close the door,
                  G
You don't have to worry any more.
Bb         C        F
I'll be your baby tonight.

Shut the light, shut the shade,
You don't have to be afraid.
I'll be your baby tonight.

<pre class="bridge">
           Bb
Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away,
F
We're gonna forget it.
     G
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon,
    C
But we're gonna let it,
[n.c.]
You won't regret it.
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
Kick your shoes off, do not fear,
Bring that bottle over here.
I'll be your baby tonight.
</pre>
