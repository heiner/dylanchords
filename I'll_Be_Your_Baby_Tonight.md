               F
    Close your eyes, close the door,
                      G
    You don't have to worry any more.
    Bb         C        F
    I'll be your baby tonight.

    Shut the light, shut the shade,
    You don't have to be afraid.
    I'll be your baby tonight.

               Bb
    Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away,
    F
    We're gonna forget it.
         G
    That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon,
        C
    But we're gonna let it,
    [n.c.]
    You won't regret it.

    Kick your shoes off, do not fear,
    Bring that bottle over here.
    I'll be your baby tonight.
